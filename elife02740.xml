binding cassette (ABC) exporters are ubiquitous ABC transporters that extrude cytotoxic molecules across cell membranes. Despite recent progress in structure determination of these transporters, the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the work of substrate translocation remains undefined. Here, we have investigated the conformational cycle of BmrCD, a representative of the heterodimer family of ABC exporters that have an intrinsically impaired nucleotide binding site. We measured distances between pairs of spin labels monitoring the movement of the nucleotide binding (NBD) and transmembrane domains (TMD). The results expose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These findings provide direct evidence of divergence in the mechanism of ABC exporters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02740.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02740.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are surrounded by a membrane that acts like a barrier to many molecules. This membrane either stops molecules from entering or exiting the cell, or at least slows their movement. However, it is important that cells can remove some molecules, such as toxins, and that nutrients and certain other molecules can get into cells. As such, cells rely on &#x2018;transporter&#x2019; proteins embedded within the membrane to move these molecules through the membrane.</p><p>Transporters called &#x2018;Multidrug ABC exporters&#x2019; are found in almost all living things, and use the energy released by breaking down molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP for short) to pump toxins out of cells. Although the three-dimensional shapes of many transporters are known, it is not clear how the energy released from ATP molecules allows the transporter to move a toxin from one side of the membrane to the other.</p><p>Here, Mishra et al. have looked at how the shape of an ABC exporter from a bacterium called <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> changes as it interacts with ATP. Most bacterial ABC exporters are made from two copies of the same protein, but the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> exporter is made from two slightly different proteins, one of which is less able to bind to and break down ATP. Mishra et al. found that those parts of the two proteins that bind to ATP can adopt a range of different shapes that had not been seen before. Moreover, the parts of the proteins that extend across the cell membrane face into the cell when the ATP binds, and switch to face out of the cell when the ATP is broken down. This movement of the proteins would allow toxic molecules inside the cell to enter the exporter, and then be pushed to the outside of the cell.</p><p>The findings of Mishra et al. show that not all ABC exporters work by the same mechanism. Future work could extend this new understanding to multidrug ABC transporters from humans, which remove waste and harmful molecules from our cells and have been implicated in resistance to chemotherapy in cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02740.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02740.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ABC transporters</kwd><kwd>double electron electron resonance (DEER)</kwd><kwd>ABC heterodimers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>none</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef identification ID: </ext-link> <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM077659, S10RR027091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Smriti</given-names></name><name><surname>Verhalen</surname><given-names>Brandy</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mchaourab</surname><given-names>Hassane S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef identification ID: </ext-link> <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>U54-GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Po-Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef identification ID: </ext-link> <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Po-Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef identification ID: </ext-link> <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>P41-GM104601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Po-Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>0.7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conformational cycle of an ABC heterodimeric transporter reveals a divergence in the structural mechanism of ABC exporters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters harness the energy of ATP to traffic a wide spectrum of molecules across cell membranes. In prokaryotes, ABC importers drive accumulation of nutrients in the cytoplasm against their concentration gradients while ABC exporters remove toxic substrates out of the cytoplasm and may function as flippases of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>). Mammalian ABC transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), are exclusively of the exporter class, play critical physiological roles and are associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>). Importers and exporters share a modular molecular architecture featuring two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs or ATP binding cassettes) that turnover ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that are presumed to form a translocation pathway across the bilayer. The four modules of ABC transporters can be encoded by separate genes and assembled as homo- or hetero-dimers, or expressed as a single polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rees et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mapping the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs to the mechanical work of substrate translocation in the TMDs is central to understanding the mechanism of ABC transporters. Crystallographic snapshots of ABC importers have revealed inward- and outward-facing states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Locher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korkhov et al., 2012</xref>) in the nomenclature of Jardetzky's alternating access model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>). Determined in the presence of substrates, substrate binding proteins and/or nucleotides, these structures were cast as representing catalytic intermediates in the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. In contrast, the proposed structural mechanism of ABC exporters is less elaborate invoking two states captured by crystallography: Inward-facing devoid of substrates and/or nucleotides (referred to as apo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2012</xref>) and outward-facing with bound nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>). While these structures highlight the possible range of conformational motion, there is no consensus regarding the suite of conformational steps that couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The quest for a unified mechanism of transport by ABC exporters has been hampered by seemingly conflicting structural and biochemical models. Inward-facing structures of the bacterial homodimer MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>) and eukaryotic Pgp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2012</xref>) have inverted V-shapes wherein the two leaflets of the transporters are separated by a large chamber open to the cytoplasm and the bilayer. In these nucleotide and substrate-free structures, the two NBDs are disengaged and separated by 10&#x2013;50 &#xc5;. In contrast, nucleotide-bound, outward-facing structures of MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>) and its homolog Sav1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2007</xref>) have the two NBDs in close contact, bringing together the ABC signature motif from one subunit and the Walker A and Walker B sequences from the other subunit to form the nucleotide binding sites (NBSs). Inward- and outward-facing exporter structures were interpreted to imply that transport entails cycles of association and dissociation of the NBDs powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In this model, substrate partitions into the large chamber cradled by the two TMDs and is pushed along to the outer membrane leaflet by ATP-induced alternating access of the chamber. However, central elements of this model are considered inconsistent with mechanistic studies, primarily of the mammalian ABC exporter Pgp, implying catalytic asymmetry between the two NBSs and constant contact between the NBDs during transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siarheyeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it would appear that an apo state, devoid of nucleotides, is unlikely to be populated or is transient under cellular ATP concentrations which are typically an order of magnitude above the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of ATP. The &#x2018;alternating site hydrolysis&#x2019; model posits that the two NBSs turnover ATP in an alternating manner constantly holding an intact ATP molecule in one of the NBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>). The conjecture that the large inward-facing cavity observed in the apo structures is required to accommodate the large substrates of exporters has also been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>) by the observation of smaller openings in the outward-facing conformations of MsbA and Sav1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Further confounding the structural perspective, a recent structure of an ABC heterodimer TM287/288 from the hyperthermophile <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> offered the first view of an ABC exporter in an inward-facing conformation where the two NBDs are partially engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike MsbA, Sav1866 and Pgp, TM287/288 is a heterodimeric ABC transporter with non-canonical sequences in the Walker B and switch motifs of one subunit resulting in a catalytically impaired NBS. In the TM287/288 structure, the impaired NBS, also referred to as the degenerate NBS, is bridged by an AMP-PNP molecule while the intact NBS, referred to as the consensus NBS, is more open creating an asymmetric NBD interface. Despite the partially engaged NBDs, the TMDs still form a chamber open to partitioning of substrates from the cytoplasm but does not appear to be accessible from the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>). This structure is consistent with biochemical studies of bacterial ABC heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lubelski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>) that suggest catalytic asymmetry between the NBSs. However, while the TM287/288 structure provides a structural basis for asymmetric nucleotide binding, it does not elucidate the mechanistic role of such an intermediate in the transport cycle in the presence of substrate and under conditions of ATP turnover. Importantly, the broader question of how the mechanism of homodimers and heterodimers differ as a consequence of impairment of an NBS remains unanswered. In addition to their importance to understanding the fundamental mechanism of transport, addressing these questions provides insight into the role of catalytic asymmetry in mammalian ABC transporters such as CFTR and TAP1/2, which play fundamental physiological roles and have been directly associated with diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abele and Tamp&#xe9;, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrov et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have investigated the conformational changes associated with specific steps in the substrate-coupled ATPase cycle of an ABC heterodimeric transporter, BmrCD from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torres et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gali&#xe1;n et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to other ABC heterodimers, sequence modifications in the consensus motifs of the NBDs, including the replacement of the Walker B catalytic glutamate by an aspartate in BmrD, suggest that ATP turnover is impaired. <italic>BmrC</italic> and <italic>BmrD</italic> genes are upregulated in the response of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to antibiotics exposure and BmrCD confers multidrug transport activity on inside-out <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torres et al., 2009</xref>) and in reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dezi et al., 2013</xref>). Spin label pairs were introduced at strategic locations to monitor the movement of the NBDs and TMDs by Double electron&#x2013;electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeschke and Polyhach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mchaourab et al., 2011</xref>). The experimental design reconstructs the conformational dynamics of the transporter by comparing distance distributions obtained under turnover conditions with those measured in trapped catalytic intermediates. Our results reveal structural asymmetry at the NBSs presumably reflecting asymmetric binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase cycle proceeds through multiple conformations of the NBD dimer while the TMDs undergo an inward- to outward-facing transition powered exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These are distinct mechanistic steps compared to ABC homodimers where a two-state association/dissociation cycle of the NBD is tightly coupled to the transition of the TMD from inward- to outward-facing conformations with ATP binding providing the power stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to define the structural dynamic consequences of the selective impairment of an NBS and to uncover divergence in the conformational cycles within the ABC exporter superfamily.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To monitor conformational changes in BmrCD as it cycles between different states driven by substrate binding and ATP turnover, we introduced pairs of spin labels, consisting of one spin label in BmrC and one spin label in BmrD, at surface-exposed sites in the NBDs and TMDs. The native cysteines of BmrD were replaced by alanines to yield a cysteine-free construct. To guide in the selection of residues for spin labeling, a homology model of BmrCD was built using the crystal structure of AMP-PNP-bound TM287/288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>) as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). A subset of the spin label pairs was designed to be structurally similar to MsbA pairs previously demonstrated to &#x2018;fingerprint&#x2019; the transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2009</xref>). We verified that cysteine-free and spin-labeled BmrCD mutants hydrolyze ATP in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) micelles and in lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>). Importanly, the rates of ATP turnover are stimulated by the transport substrate Hoechst33342 (hereafter referred as Hoechst) except for the 533/625 pair. Therefore, this pair will be interpreted only in the context of the overall data set describing the movement of the NBDs as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conformational states of BmrCD NBDs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of BmrCD homology model showing the spin label pairs at symmetric sites across the NBD dimer interface (the transporter is rotated 90&#xb0; and NBD interface is viewed from cytoplasm).

Three distinct conformations for apo, AMP-PNP-bound and the HES intermediates are deduced from the shifts in distance distributions at the NBSs for all the pairs.

The breadth of the AMP-PNP distribution at the consensus NBS demonstrates that ATP binding enables a range of conformations to be populated that includes the HES. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis is required to observe an HES population at the degenerate NBS as inferred from the predominantly distinct distributions in the presence of AMP-PNP and ADP-Vi.

However, the differences in the population amplitude of these states reveal that the two NBSs do not have to concurrently be in the same catalytic intermediate. For example, while a significant population of the consensus NBS is in apo-like conformation, the degenerate NBS is predominantly in either the nucleotide-bound or HES-like conformations. Such an asymmetric disengagement of the signature and Walker A motifs at the consensus NBS, which requires their separation by more than 20&#x2013;40 &#xc5;, is not structurally compatible with an HES-like conformation at the degenerate NBS. Therefore, the distributions under turnover conditions imply the existence of a transporter intermediate wherein the degenerate NBS is ATP-bound while the consensus NBS assumes an apo-like conformation. Similarly, we can infer the presence of another state of the transporter wherein the degenerate NBS is in a HES-like state and the consensus NBS is in the ATP-bound conformation.</p><p>Longer incubation times shift the distribution towards the ATP/ADP-bound population at the degenerate NBS (compare 1 and 5 min time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) while at similar incubation times, the consensus site shows a considerably larger population in the ATP-bound and the apo states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The addition of the substrate Hoechst, which accelerates the rate of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>), simply shifts the populations at both NBSs towards those obtained at the longer incubation time.

Pairs of spin labels were introduced in each MsbA protomer with the purpose of monitoring the two NBSs following the design principles described above for BmrCD. Because MsbA is a homodimer, this strategy introduces four spin labels in the functional unit related by six distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). If the NBD interface is twofold symmetric, three of these distances are unique (d1, d2, d3, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Two distances relate labels at distinct sites: one is short range (d1) arising from pairs monitoring the NBS while the other represents symmetry-related sites that interact across the dimer interface and is considerably longer (d2). Therefore, in addition to considerations of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>) and surface localization, the two sites, 350 and 471, were selected to maximize the differences between spin labels reporting on the NBS conformation vs those reporting the distance between symmetry-related spin labels in the dimer. These selection criteria simplify the interpretation of the distance distributions and allow for the identification of the components that arise from dipolar coupling between spin labels across the NBS. However, the projection of the spin labels relative to the C&#x3b1; breaks the symmetry leading to distinct distances in the 350/350 and 471/471 pairs. This complication does not affect the interpretation of the short component which monitors the NBSs.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>MsbA conformational dynamics under turnover conditions reveal a two-state equilibrium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of the AMP-PNP structure of MsbA (PDB:3B60) showing the spin-labeled pairs.

In contrast, this short distance component is present to the same extent in the AMP-PNP-bound and ADP-Vi intermediates supporting the previous conclusion that ATP binding is the power stroke of transport for MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

No other short distance component is detected as would be expected if the NBS were structurally asymmetric; although the detection of such asymmetry is limited by the intrinsic width of the distance distributions. Thus, we conclude that the two NBSs are structurally equivalent in the HES. The longer distance components in the distance distribution can be accounted for by the other distances (d2, d3) relating the two pairs of spin labels in the homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The two conformations of the NBDs, that is the disengaged and closed, are coupled to inward- and outward-facing conformations of the TMD respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>).

Under turnover conditions, the distance distributions were distinctly bimodal in the presence of ATP consistent with a partitioning of the transporter between inward- and outward-facing bound conformations. In contrast to BmrCD, the equilibrium of MsbA favors an outward-facing conformation. The predominance of the outward-facing conformation of the TMD is consistent with the persistence of the NBS short distance component under turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major novel finding of this paper is that sequence asymmetry in the NBDs shapes the mechanism of energy transduction in ABC exporters.

In contrast to the ATP-induced association/dissociation cycle of NBDs in bacterial homodimers reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2009</xref>) and further confirmed here, the NBDs of heterodimers form structurally asymmetric dimers as a consequence of ATP binding and its subsequent hydrolysis. We uncovered conformations wherein the impaired NBS holds on to an ATP molecule while the consensus NBS disengages enabling product release and rebinding of ATP. Asymmetric NBD conformations were hypothesized from the elegant mechanistic analysis of Pgp by Senior et al. but were not directly detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tombline et al., 2005</xref>). We propose that the distinct mechanism of heterodimers requires a less efficient coupling between the NBD and TMD, a &#x2018;conformational leak&#x2019;, to enable NBD movement without transmission to the TMDs. This would require a tuning of the sequences and interactions of the IH1 and IH2 coupling loops and possibly the cytoplasmic extension of TMs, regions hypothesized to form the transmission interface between the NBDs and TMDs of ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oancea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loo et al., 2013</xref>). There is a substantial impact of lipids on the coupling between the NBD and TMD. Transmission of the conformational changes to the TMD is more stringently dependent on the presence of substrate in lipid bilyaers. This finding is consistent with previous work revealing that lipids can shift the conformational preferences of ion-coupled transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanelt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This novel insight was derived from experiments that monitor transporter conformational states under turnover conditions. Unlike previous studies, which investigated exclusively stable intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2009</xref>), here the mechanistic implications of these intermediates were challenged under substrate and nucleotide conditions that mimic those of the cell. Another unique experimental design is the selective monitoring of individual NBSs rather than the NBD interface facilitated by the heterodimeric nature of BmrCD. NBS distance distributions capture the interconversion of the transporter between conformations corresponding to those observed under trapped conditions, thereby establishing the direct relevance of the trapped conformations to the substrate-coupled ATPase cycle. Furthermore, the observation of a steady state population of apo-like conformation of the consensus NBS, even in the presence of excess ATP, prompts us to conclude that disengagement of this NBS is required for ADP-Pi dissociation and subsequent binding of ATP, thereby establishing the mechanistic significance of a local apo-like conformation.</p><p>Our results can be framed in a model of how asymmetric ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs drive transition of the TMDs between inward- and outward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Distinguishing features of this model include the formation of structurally asymmetric conformations of the NBDs and the association of the transporter power stroke with ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of cellular ATP concentrations, BmrCD will have at least one ATP molecule bound, most likely at the degenerate NBS as evidenced by the fact that an apo-like conformation was nearly undetectable at this NBS in the presence of excess ATP. Such an ATP-bound resting state does not hinder substrate access to the putative binding chamber at the TMD interface, since ATP binding does not induce closure of the cytoplasmic side of BmrCD. ATP binding to the consensus NBS yields an intermediate with two ATP molecules bound (&#x2018;1&#x2019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We refer to this conformation of the NBD dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as a pre-hydrolysis intermediate reminiscent of the pre-hydrolysis complex observed in a crystal structure of the maltose transporter, MalK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oldham and Chen, 2011</xref>). In this conformation, the NBDs are engaged but the NBSs have not formed the canonical configuration and are therefore not catalytically competent. ATP turnover is initiated by fluctuations at the consensus NBS which enables transition to a hydrolysis-competent configuration (HES-like) as deduced from the overlapping distance distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. This is a relatively minor population of the transporter which likely explains the relatively slow ATP turnover by BmrCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>). ATP hydrolysis switches TMD accessibility thereby catalyzing the extrusion of the substrate. Turnover rates are stimulated if the substrate binds prior to hydrolysis but there is a considerable basal consumption of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>). While there is evidence of ATP turnover by impaired NBSs, consideration of the reaction mechanism as well as previous biochemical studies of ABC heterodimers support an intrinsically slower rate at the degenerate NBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Procko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncoeur et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, ADP and Pi are released from the consensus site prior to hydrolysis at the degenerate site enabling multiple rounds of asymmetric ATP hydrolysis without the complete disengagement of the NBDs to an apo conformation.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Distinct mechanisms of ABC heterodimers and homodimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Asymmetric hydrolysis of ATP in an ABC heterodimer. The conformation of the transporter and a top view of the NBD dimer are shown for each catalytic state. Substrate binding can precede or follow ATP binding to the NBSs.

Whether ATP hydrolysis at the degenerate NBS could occur prior or concomitant with release of ADP and Pi from the consensus NBS cannot be conclusively addressed from our data. However, the negligible population of apo-like degenerate NBS and the fact that ADP-bound NBDs form a partially engaged dimer argue against significant population of an apo state of the transporter where the two NBDs are separated by more than 50 &#xc5;. Thus, this &#x2018;global&#x2019; apo state (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) appears not to be mechanistically relevant in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of ABC heterodimers. We propose that ADP-Pi release, as a consequence of infrequent hydrolysis at the degenerate site, occurs while ATP is bound at the consensus NBS.</p><p>If the degenerate site is not turning over ATP at levels comparable to the consensus NBS, how is the significant HES-like population observed under turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) accounted for? We speculate that hydrolysis at the consensus NBS requires transition of the degenerate NBS to an ATP-occluded state along the lines of the model proposed for Pgp on the basis of experiments with catalytically impaired NBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>). This state would relax to the nucleotide-bound conformation following hydrolysis at the consensus NBS (state 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic elements of ATP turnover for ABC heterodimers and homodimers are contrasted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. For the latter, the NBSs are identical in sequence and there is no experimental evidence of catalytic inequivalence. Analysis of MsbA conformational dynamics reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</xref>) and extended here is entirely consistent with a model of turnover that invokes engaged and disengaged NBD states, symmetric NBS conformations, and tight structural coupling between the NBDs and the TMDs. We conclude from the comparative analysis of BmrCD and MsbA conformational cycles that the controversy regarding NBD disengagement vs constant contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>) is a consequence of extrapolation of models between mechanistically distinct classes of ABC exporters.</p><p>The structural mechanism of ABC heterodimers described here is a remarkable example of variations on a common conformational cycle in the context of conserved transporter architecture. While all ABC transporters derive energy from an ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle, fundamental differences exist in the regulation of ATP turnover by catalytic elements and/or structural intermediates as evidenced here. Although it was anticipated that the inward- to outward-facing transition of ABC exporters would follow the structural mechanics defined by the structures of MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>), we show in this work that coupling of the TMD transition to the ATPase cycle is not identical between subclasses of exporters. Evidence of more variation in the coupling mechanism has emerged recently from a structure of a human ABC homodimer where the NBSs are disengaged even in the presence of AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shintre et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, if indeed TMD conformational changes require hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule in heterodimers, it raises the conundrum of why two molecules are hydrolyzed in ABC homodimers to achieve what would appear to be similar type of mechanical work. Addressing these questions is the next frontier in understanding the mechanism of ABC exporters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Homology modeling of BmrCD</title><p>A homology model of the inward-facing BmrCD was constructed with MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marti-Renom et al., 2000</xref>), using the crystal structure of the asymmetric ABC transporter TM287/288 (PDB: 3QF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>) as the template. In order to correctly map the consensus and degenerate nucleotide-binding sites, TMD287 was chosen as the template for BmrC and TMD288 as a template for BmrD. The alignment between BmrC and TM287 was directly generated by pairwise Blastp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, due to low sequence identity, the homology of the first &#x223c;150 amino acids of BmrD could not be determined through direct pairwise alignment. The BmrD/TM288 alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1B</xref>) was instead obtained by manually optimizing a multiple alignment involving sequences of BmrC, BmrD, TM287, TM288, and SAV1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1C</xref>), which was generated using Clustal-&#x3a9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>). In the multiple alignment, the N-terminal region of BmrD (Met1-Leu48) is aligned to the elbow helix and the TM1 of other ABC transporters, followed by a heterologous insertion of &#x223c;100 residues. Assuming the aligned sequence within a transmembrane helix is ungapped, the BmrD alignment near the heterologous insertion was then manually optimized by ungapped extension from the aligned sequence immediately C-terminal to the inserted region, which covers most of the TM2 of TM288. Similarly, the alignment of BmrD/TM288 near the TM5 (Asn333-Gly365 of BmrD) was also manually optimized due to its lower local sequence identity and the presence of inserted residues in the transmembrane region of the BmrD sequence. The inserted region of BmrD (Cys49&#x2013;Ile146) was not modeled due to the lack of homologous sequence in any protein structure. The final sequence alignment used for homology modeling is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The motivation for developing this software was to carry out global analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beechem, 1992</xref>) of the DEER decays obtained under different conditions for the same spin label pair. The distance distribution is assumed to consist of a sum of Gaussians, the number of which is determined based on a statistical criterion. The optimal number of Gaussian components and the center, width and amplitude of each component were allowed to vary between conditions. The slope of the background was assumed to be uniform across the data set but was fit rather than set by the user. Care was taken to ensure that the concentration of samples for the same spin label pair were identical within experimental error. The statistical significance between fits with increasing number of Gaussian distributions was determined using an F test. The root-mean squared difference between the data and fit was minimized using the trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented in the MATLAB routine &#x2018;lsqnonlin&#x2019;. We compared results from this analysis to those obtained by using the package DeerAnalysis 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeschke et al., 2006</xref>) for data obtained in the trapped conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1&#x2013;3</xref>) and found that the resulting distributions are very similar.

Your revised article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor, John Kuriyan, as well as by a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, along with two peer reviewers. In general we think that you have shown that the new mechanism that you propose exists both in detergent micelles as well as in a lipid environment. To show this equivalence was the central criticism of the original review.</p><p>However, before the manuscript can be formally accepted, several minor issues, outlined below, should be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) On the basis of the new experiments the authors emphasize how well the detergent and nano disc experiments agree. Although for many conclusions they indeed agree well, there are also very pronounced differences. The main difference is mentioned only in the Results section (and not in the Discussion): The stringent dependence on the inward-outward transition on the presence of substrate. This data clearly shows that the dynamics is different in lipid bilayers compared to detergent solution, and the authors should discuss this point in more detail (also in relation to relevant literature that similarly showed subtle yet important differences in the behavior of membrane transport proteins in detergent vs lipid, e.g., Hanelt et al Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2013 Feb;20(2):210-4.).</p><p>2) Although the authors explain their Gaussian method in the rebuttal, some questions remain: What does the expression &#x201c;relatively unique&#x201d; mean? Perhaps the crucial question is: can the reliability of the fits be quantified in a way that the reader (non-specialist) can understand? In particular, the authors mention that their method provides statistical tools, yet there does not seem to be a statistical evaluation of the data in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Related to the point above: Why is the noise in the DEER signals so different for the different mutants (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 4</xref>: compare 555/647 with 533/625). Does the noise affect the reliability?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 4</xref> the positions are labeled 55/147 in the structural overviews, but 55/146 in the distance plots. Which one is correct?</p><p>[Editors&#x2019; note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &#x201c;Conformational dynamics of the nucleotide binding domains and the power stroke of a heterodimeric ABC transporter&#x201d; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior Editor, John Kuriyan, as well as by a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, along with two peer reviewers. We regret to inform you that after discussions between the reviewers the decision was made that your work will not be considered further for publication.</p><p>While all reviewers see the importance and also the novelty of your results, there is substantial concern regarding several technical aspects of your study. While some of these could be dealt with by providing further details and explanations of the experimental procedures, some of the criticism would require additional experiments. In particular, the potential influence of the detergent on the results of the measurements was a major concern during the discussion of your paper among the reviewers and editors. Showing that the results are also valid in a bilayer environment would probably take several months. Due to this concern as well as some other technical questions, it was decided that additional proof of the validity of the results in liposomes are required before the paper could be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. A detailed list of all comments of the individual reviewers is provided at the end &#x2013; these comments are provided for your information, and have not been merged to reflect the final consensus decision among the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer &#x23;1:</italic></p><p>Miahra et al have investigated the conformational dynamics of the ABC exporter BmrCD. Despite several crystal structures that have been solved of ABC transporters in different states, the mechanism that couples the hydrolysis of ATP to the translocation process of small molecules across the membrane is not understood. BmrCD is a heterodimeric ABC exporter with one functional and one impaired nucleotide binding site. By using spin label pairs and DEER measurements the authors show that in contrast to similar studies with the homodimers MsbA, three different orientations of the NBDs with respect to each other can be identified, depending on whether the NBSs do not contain a nucleotide, are trapped in the post hydrolysis state or are bound to a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog. Investigating these conformational states under ATP turn over conditions showed that the NBDs form asymmetric heterodimers with the degenerate NBS being in an ATP bound or post-hydrolysis state while the consensus NBS shows all three states. This asymmetry leads to a weaker coupling between the NBDs and their ATP hydrolysis cycle and the TMD conformations. In contrast, in homodimers there is a stronger coupling.</p><p>Based on these DEER measurements the authors propose a model that shows that the degenerate site most of the time binds ATP while the consensus site shows a much faster cycling between different states. This is clearly different from the model suggested for homodimers.</p><p>The data are well presented and report on an important mechanistic aspect of ABC transporter function. Such a detailed study of the asymmetry of the two nucleotide binding sites is new and of interest beyond the ABC transporter field.</p><p>A few remarks remain:</p><p>1) If the coupling between the ATP hydrolysis and the substrate transport is less strong than in homo dimers, it would be expected that more ATP molecules per transported substrate molecule must be hydrolyzed. Has this number been measured?</p><p>2) Measuring of the ATP hydrolysis of the different spin labeled mutants shows for some of them quite significant differences where for example basal and stimulated activity are almost equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref>). This should be discussed in the main text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer &#x23;2:</italic></p><p>General:</p><p>I like the approach and the results look very interesting, but it is a missed chance that the authors have chosen to do all their experiments in detergent solubilized state of the protein. Membrane transporters require a lipid bilayer to function, and EPR is one of the few techniques that can be used to study structural and mechanistic details in the membrane. Similar EPR work is now done routinely in the membrane-reconstituted state. In particular, I am concerned that the apparent uncoupling between the events in the NBSs and the TMDs in BmrCD could be an artifact of the detergent solution. Validation of the results in lipid bilayers is therefore needed.</p><p>Method:</p><p>The authors use a home-made and unpublished method in which they fit Gaussians to analyze the DEER spectra. The new method appears to result in distance distributions that look very &#x201c;clean&#x201d; and distances that are well defined. I am not an expert on this part, but it seems to me that the new method should be validated/tested more rigorously. The comparison with the established methods, which the authors apparently have done, should be presented. How do the distance distributions look when the standard base-line corrections are used? The authors state that the number of Gaussians, the amplitude and the width are fitted: how do these parameters behave?

This would be understandable only if they are measuring under pre-steady state conditions. I find it unlikely that the conditions are pre-steady state, because from the Pi release rates it can be calculated that for all mutant pairs there is at least one turnover per BmrCD (7nmol/mg) per minute (even in the absence of Hoechst). In any case, why would one desire to measure under pre-steady state conditions? And if the authors are interested in this type of kinetics then two time points are certainly not sufficient. What happens between 1 and 5 minutes of incubation?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the relevant conditions is 5 min plus Hoechst, and <italic>not</italic> 1 min without Hoechst.

The authors make two major conclusions, but only one is stated in the Abstract, namely that the two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis, the so-called power stoke; and that sequence asymmetry in the NBDs shapes the mechanism of energy transduction in ABC heterodimeric exporters. The authors come to this conclusion from their analyses of DEER measurements in BmrCD, and relate these data to earlier studies (theirs and others) of homodimers with two canonical ATP sites in the NBDs, chiefly MsbA. Many of these results are questionable or at least require explanation and refinement, as outlined in the detailed points below. However, the (un-highlighted) second major finding of this study relates to the models depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which shows cartoons for the distinctively different mechanisms that drive ABC heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>With respect to the DEER data described here, it should be made clear what these distances refer to. Are they the measured distances between the probes, or estimates of the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distances of the respective residues based on these measures? So for example, the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance between BmrCD 555/647 based on the Sav1866 structure is around 37 &#xc5;; does the DEER distance for the Vi-trapped state of 45 &#xc5; reflect the additional distance added by the probe or does it reflect a greater C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance than predicted by the structure? This is quite an important distinction since a 7 &#xc5; difference from the crystal structure could reflect a semi-open NBD dimer.</p><p>Vanadate traps the transporter by mimicking the pentacoordinate transition state, such that the protein cannot progress from this state. However, it is not clear in what sense this conformation is &#x201c;high energy&#x201d;. Indeed, given the stability of the species, does it not represent a free energy trough? The authors should state in what sense the intermediate is high energy and what evidence there is for that contention.</p><p>&#x201c;This suggests large relative movement between the two NBDs upon energy input that brings them closer together.&#x201d;</p><p>The authors should be clearer as to the nature of this energy input. The impression overall is that the notion of high energy is used somewhat vaguely in order to suggest that the energy of ATP is used to induce NBD closure, which is a high energy state, but none of this is explicitly stated or explained. How for example can the trapped state be formed from ADP&#x2b;Pi (i.e., without requiring ATP hydrolysis, as has been reported) if it is a high energy state and NBD closure requires energy from ATP?</p><p>Given that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tombline et al (2005)</xref> and others have shown that nucleotide is occluded in only one site in the Vi-trapped state, and that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siarheyeva et al (2010)</xref> have found that the non-occluded site is accessible, on what basis do the authors contend that the Vi-trapped state is equivalent to the closed NBD sandwich dimer observed in crystal structures?</p><p>Results section:</p><p>&#x201c;This is in stark contrast to the ABC homodimer, MsbA, where ATP binding and HES trapping stabilize the same conformation?

Moreover, Borbat (2007) only provides data for NBD residue MsbA 539, which is equivalent to BmrCD 533/625, which according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, also does not show any difference between ATP-bound and Vi-trapped states for this residue pair. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al (2009)</xref>, DEER distances for residue 561, equivalent to BmrCD 555/647, were not reported for the ATP-bound state. Thus, it is not clear on what basis the authors claim that the difference in behaviour for these positions between MsbA and BmrCD are &#x201c;stark&#x201d;, and point to fundamental functional differences.</p><p>&#x201c;These characteristics suggest that ATP binding, mimicked by AMP-PNP, nucleates the formation of an NBD dimer distinct from the canonical closed NBD sandwich observed in the crystal structures of nucleotide-bound MsbA.&#x201d;</p><p>As discussed above, this is highly interpretive and based on questionable premises, and is thus not appropriate in the &#x27;Results&#x27; section.</p><p>&#x201c;This state has features of the closed NBD sandwich (stabilized by ADP-Vi).&#x201d;</p><p>The results show that, with respect to the core subdomain, as reported by 533/625 immediately downstream of the H-loop, the NBDs remain the same distance apart regardless of whether ATP, ADP, or ADP&#x2b;Pi is bound, and that positions 555/647 are moved relative to each other and also to 533/625 in the transition state, relative to the ATP and ADP-bound states. Since 555/647 residues are toward the C-terminal, this may reflect a functional flexibility of this region relative to the core of the NBD, rather than a starkly different conformation of the NBDs?</p><p>In some cases the choice of position to attach probes is mystifying. For example, position 533/625, according to homology with Sav1866, is usually a large hydrophobic residue, which is buried and engaged in interactions with the C-terminal helix as well as the hydrophobic core of the core subdomain. Attachment of a probe at this position appears likely to disrupt significantly the structure at this point, as also suggested by the fact that basal and substrate-stimulated ATPase are about the same for 533/625.</p><p>Position 461/552 is a highly conserved leucine, buried very near the active site. It appears likely that a probe at this point would either sterically interfere with the nucleotide binding pocket or require the protein to fold non-natively at this point to accommodate the probe when nucleotide is bound at the proximal site. Again, the functional data suggest significant disruption for this probe position. The authors should discuss the possibility that probe attached to positions 461/552 could impinge on the nucleotide-binding pocket.</p><p>Why were conserved buried residue positions chosen to attach probes, while in other cases far more suitable choices were made (e.g., 392/484)?</p><p>&#x201c;While ATP binding, mimicked by addition of AMP-PNP, induces the formation...&#x201d;</p><p>The authors have interpreted their DEER data as indicating dimerisation of the NBDs upon addition of ATP to the apo state. It is difficult to conceive how the NBDs could dimerise without inducing the inward- to outward-facing switch in the NBDs, and also how having done so, hydrolysis could then induce the TMD switch? NBD dimerisation while the TMDs remained in the inward-facing conformation would require the CHs to disengage from the NBDs, in which case no ATP hydrolysis signal could be transmitted to the TMDs. This appears clear. It doesn&#x27;t seem sufficient to simply postulate &#x201c;large independent movement&#x201d; of the NBDs, when in terms of the crystal structures and the switch mechanism, such a thing appears impossible. In what structural scenario could this happen?</p><p>Surely the data show that under steady state transport conditions the degenerate NBS does not sample significantly the widely open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), that the consensus NBS is predominantly within 25 &#xc5; of the fully occluded conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; 5min) and the extracellular separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) all but never happens? As discussed above, the data for the 533/625 pair indicate that all the distance changes observed between ADP&#x2b;Vi-trapped and ATP-bound and ADP-bound states must be due to local changes, since the 533/625 pair does not change between these states. 515/607 are located on the D-helix, 440/532 on the &#x03B1;3-4 loop, and 441/348 on the A-loop. These positions have been found in MD simulations to be highly flexible, undergoing significant (ie &#x3e;10 &#xc5;) changes while the NBDs remain closed at one NBS. The picture that emerges from the present data is similar to that for P-gp in Verhalen et al, (2012), where the protein doesn&#x27;t sample the widely apart conformation to any significant extent during normal cycling.</p><p>&#x201c;No other short distance component is detected as would be expected if the NBS were structurally asymmetric...&#x201d;</p><p>For the single mutant 350, the distance of 67 &#xc5; under nucleotide-bound conditions (Figure 6&#x2013;figure supplement 2) is some 18 &#xc5; longer than the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance between the residue pair in the closed NBD crystal structure. Given a C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance between 350-471 of 20 &#xc5; in the closed state, the middle peak distance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> of 53 &#xc5;, when a similar correction of 18 &#xc5; is applied, comes to a C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance of 35 &#xc5;. This is an increase of 15 &#xc5;. Since rotations of the core subdomain of this magnitude have been observed in MD simulations of the closed Sav1866 NBD dimer, these results do not preclude the possibility that the intermediate distance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> does not represent a semi-open asymmetric state of the NBD dimer. The peak distances for the single mutants do not match the peak distances in the double mutants. This should be explained.</p><p>&#x201c;Thus, we conclude that the two NBSs are structurally equivalent during MsbA ATPase cycle.&#x201d;</p><p>This is not sustained. Clearly, it is possible that the broad peak for the longest distance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> in fact represents the combined signals for the longer distance in a semi-open dimer in which one core subdomain is rotated open (downward away from the ICLs and outward from the opposite helical subdomain) by a distance of around 15 &#xc5;. This possibility should be discussed.</p><p>For the detection of the TMD conformational changes, why were not equivalently located residues as those used for BmrACD used? Residue 158 appears to be located within the membrane. Also, given that the probes attached to position 158 would clearly point away from each other, the DEER distance for the outward-facing state is only around 8 &#xc5; greater, whereas as discussed above, additional distances added by the probe, according to the authors&#x27; interpretation, reached over 15 &#xc5;. In the inward-facing structure of MsbA, C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distances for residue 158 are around 40 &#xc5;, exactly the same as in the outward-facing conformation. Why was this position chosen? Why does it change when the structures predict it doesn&#x27;t? Does this not mean the results are at odds with the mechanistic interpretation derived from the structures?</p><p>&#x201c;In contrast to BmrCD, the equilibrium distinctly favors an outward-facing conformation.&#x201d;</p><p>How do the authors draw this conclusion?</p><p>&#x201c;We propose that the distinct catalytic mechanism of heterodimers requires a less efficient coupling between the NBD and TMD, a &#x27;conformational leak&#x27;, to enable NBD movement without transmission to the TMDs.&#x201d;</p><p>This proposal is fine as proposals go, but it suggests that heterodimers operate with a different or additional minor(?) structural conformational change in the non-canonical NBD than in homodimers, and that this change is not transmitted to the TMDs. Since not all movements of ABC NBDs could possibly be transmitted to the TMDs, except in a concerted and allosteric &#x27;global&#x27; sense, the use of the term &#x27;conformational leak&#x27; is difficult to sustain without further explanation? How can this be construed as a mechanistic step in heterodimers, yet be completely absent in homodimers?</p><p>&#x201c;Our results can be framed in a model of how asymmetric ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs drive transition of the TMDs between inward- and outward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).&#x201d;</p><p>Unfortunately the points above significantly blunt the force of this finding; and it is difficult to sustain this model without clarification of the data. Refer also to the next and final comments.</p><p>&#x201c;The mechanistic elements of ATP turnover for ABC heterodimers and homodimers are contrasted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>... Analysis of MsbA conformational dynamics reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>) and extended here is entirely consistent with a model of turnover that invokes engaged and disengaged NBD states, symmetric NBS conformations, and tight structural coupling between the NBDs and the TMDs. We conclude from the comparative analysis of BmrCD and MsbA conformational cycles that the controversy regarding NBD disengagement versus constant contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>) is a consequence of extrapolation of models between mechanistically distinct classes of ABC exporters.&#x201d;</p><p>If I read the extract of text here and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (A&#x26;B) correctly, the authors seem to be concluding that the mechanisms for ABC heterodimers and homodimers are different, a conclusion that I find extraordinary. Given that heterodimers have canonical and non-canonical ATP catalytic sites and homodimers have dual canonical sites, I take it that the authors are drawing a vast distinction between ATP binding, and very slow hydrolysis, in non-canonical sites, with rapid ATP hydrolysis in canonical sites, and that this separates the mechanistic pathways of in hetero- and homodimers as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The representation of heterodimers as proceeding via a so-called &#x201c;constant contact&#x201d; model and homodimers by the so-called Switch model defies credibility in such a closely related family of transporters and for which the NBDs are the most highly conserved domains. This needs to be explained and justified in clear detail.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) On the basis of the new experiments the authors emphasize how well the detergent and nano disc experiments agree.

In addition to the absence of any direct evidence that such model can or should be extended to other ABC transporters, one of the major points of the paper is to demonstrate that indeed there are distinct conformational mechanisms for the various ABC exporters. With the constructive responses below, we urge the reviewer to approach the data with an open mind.</p><p>&#x201c;The results purport to depose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from an asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites&#x2026;&#x201d;</p><p>This comment is confusing: we demonstrate the existence of such intermediates; not depose previous results. We note that the structure of TM287/288 is asymmetric at the NBS supporting our findings.</p><p><italic>With respect to the DEER data described here, it should be made clear what these distances refer to. Are they the measured distances between the probes, or estimates of the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distances of the respective residues based on these measures? So for example, the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance between BmrCD 555/647 based on the Sav1866 structure is around 37 &#xc5;; does the DEER distance for the Vi-trapped state of 45 &#xc5; reflect the additional distance added by the probe or does it reflect a greater C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance than predicted by the structure? This is quite an important distinction since a 7 &#xc5; difference from the crystal structure could reflect a semi-open NBD dimer</italic>.</p><p>The comments below clearly show that the reviewer understands the distinction between the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance and the distance between the spin labels. Therefore, we can only speculate that this comment is meant to clarify it for the general reader. Therefore, we have added two sentences that describe the general relationship between the average distance that separate the spin labels and the &#x03B1;-carbons. This topic has been described in multiple publications from various groups including the corresponding author. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref> shows an example of the predicted distance distributions for the two NBD pairs.</p><p>As to the particular pair 555/647, it was selected based on the sequence alignment with MsbA and Sav1866. The equivalent position in MsbA yields almost identical average distance and a narrow distribution in the ATP-bound state as well as following trapping by vanadate. Based on the relatively high resolution structures of MsbA and Sav1866 (pdbID 3b60 (AMP-PNP structure) and 2hyd, respectively), we assign this distance to the canonical closed NBD sandwich. The origin of the difference between the measure distance and the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance is the projection of the two spin labels in opposite direction as discussed in Borbat et al and Zou et al and is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Indeed a semi-closed dimer is populated upon binding of AMP-PNP. The deviation here, approximately 15 &#xc5;, cannot be explained away by the orientation of the spin labels. The EPR lineshape, a signature of the dynamics of the spin labels does not change, consistent with the notion that the 15 &#xc5; distance change between the AMP-PNP bound and HES states arise from movement of the NBDs.</p><p><italic>Vanadate traps the transporter by mimicking the pentacoordinate transition state, such that the protein cannot progress from this state. However, it is not clear in what sense this conformation is &#x201c;high energy&#x201d;. Indeed, given the stability of the species, does it not represent a free energy trough? The authors should state in what sense the intermediate is high energy and what evidence there is for that contention</italic>.</p><p>The ABC transporter literature more than adequately describes the nature of the vanadate trapped species. Sharma and Davidson even refer to this state as the transition state of ATP hydrolysis that is by definition a high energy state. We preferred in our papers to re-name it &#x201c;a high energy post hydrolysis state&#x201d; in deference to the enzymology literature that reserves the word transition state to a fleetingly populated state. Our usage of the term implies that in the apo or substrate bound intermediate i.e., in the absence of energy input, the transporter cannot sample this conformation. ATP binding and/or hydrolysis lowers the energy of the HES as would be expected. In a way, this is a matter of semantics but it should not cause confusion since it is well described in the field and in our previous publications as well as in the first usage of the term in this manuscript.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;This suggests large relative movement between the two NBDs upon energy input that brings them closer together&#x201d;</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors should be clearer as to the nature of this energy input. The impression overall is that the notion of high energy is used somewhat vaguely in order to suggest that the energy of ATP is used to induce NBD closure, which is a high energy state, but none of this is explicitly stated or explained. How for example can the trapped state be formed from ADP&#x2b;Pi (i.e</italic>. <italic>without requiring ATP hydrolysis, as has been reported) if it is a high energy state and NBD closure requires energy from ATP?</italic></p><p>We explicitly describe the energy input as driving the population of this high energy state. We repeatedly note that ATP binding, mimicked by AMP-PNP, does not lead to the formation of the NBD sandwich observed in the structures of MsbA and Sav1866. Thus there is no vagueness.</p><p>There is no direct evidence supporting NBD closure by addition of ADP and Pi at least for ABC homodimers and heterodimers. There are results from Pgp showing that ATP hydrolysis can be inhibited with pre-incubation with ADP&#x2b;Pi or ADP&#x2b;Vi but we fail to see the relevance here. There is literature from ABC importers that addition of ADP and Vi (not Pi) can indeed stabilize the HES. As noted above, we do not agree that mechanistic elements determined for one class of ABC transporters should be generalized without direct evidence to another class, particularly when the canonical sequences of the NBD are divergent. Furthermore, it is identified through measurements at multiple locations that although there is some conformational change with the binding of the ATP analog AMP-PNP, the transition to outward-facing is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis which is described by the measurements in the presence of ATP&#x2b;Vi.</p><p><italic>Given that</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"><italic>Tombline et al (2005)</italic></xref> <italic>and others have shown that nucleotide is occluded in only one site in the Vi-trapped state</italic>, <italic>and that</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45"><italic>Siarheyeva et al (2010)</italic></xref> <italic>have found that the non-occluded site is accessible, on what basis do the authors contend that the Vi-trapped state is equivalent to the closed NBD sandwich dimer observed in crystal structures?</italic></p><p>The basis of the conclusion is the data: we can trap both NBSs in the canonical conformation as evidenced by the distance distribution of three spin label pairs for each NBS. Therefore, in the presence of ATP&#x2b;Vi that stabilizes the ADP-Vi HES, the data informs that there can be no asymmetry in the conformation of the two NBSs, at least for BmrCD and MsbA (see below).</p><p>The data that the reviewer cites is from Pgp (Tombline) and again illustrates the reviewer&#x2019;s conviction that data obtained from a highly divergent ABC transporter describe the mechanism of other ABC transporters, a notion that is simply not supported by the literature to our knowledge. One of the main points of this paper is that indeed there are distinct variations in the conformational cycle that may explain the discrepancy between structural and mechanistic data that have led to much controversy in the field.</p><p><italic>Results section:</italic></p><p><italic>&#x201c;This is in stark contrast to the ABC homodimer</italic>, <italic>MsbA, where ATP binding and HES trapping stabilize the same conformation? (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><italic>Borbat et al., 2007</italic></xref><italic>).&#x201d;</italic></p><p><italic>The reference does not appear to include data for the ATP-bound state. Moreover, Borbat (2007) only provides data for NBD residue MsbA 539, which is equivalent to BmrCD 533/625, which according to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>, also does not show any difference between ATP-bound and Vi-trapped states for this residue pair. In</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54"><italic>Zou et al (2009)</italic></xref><italic>, DEER distances for residue 561, equivalent to BmrCD 555/647, were not reported for the ATP-bound state. Thus, it is not clear on what basis the authors claim that the difference in behaviour for these positions between MsbA and BmrCD are &#x201c;stark&#x201d;, and point to fundamental functional differences</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the data was not explicitly shown and we apologize for this oversight. We have remedied this issue by including in the supplementary material the data for the AMP-PNP bound state of MsbA 561 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1&#x2013;Figure supplement 5</xref>). It shows an almost superimposable distribution to that of the Vi-trapped state in &#x201c;stark contrast&#x201d; to BmrCD. This is also consistent with the crystallographic data that shows the formation of the canonical NBD dimer in the presence of AMP-PNP<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>&#x201c;These characteristics suggest that ATP binding, mimicked by AMP-PNP, nucleates the formation of an NBD dimer distinct from the canonical closed NBD sandwich observed in the crystal structures of nucleotide-bound MsbA&#x201d;</italic>.</p><p><italic>As discussed above, this is highly interpretive and based on questionable premises, and is thus not appropriate in the &#x27;Results&#x27; section</italic>.</p><p>We respectfully disagree. This conclusion is a direct interpretation of the data and does not involve a speculative argument: the distributions of seven spin label pairs across the NBDs and NBSs are distinct for AMP-PNP and Vi-trapped states. The conclusion is further supported by turnover data that establish that these conformations are populated in the presence of ATP.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;This state has features of the closed NBD sandwich (stabilized by ADP-Vi)</italic>.<italic>&#x201d;</italic></p><p><italic>The results show that, with respect to the core subdomain, as reported by 533/625 immediately downstream of the H-loop, the NBDs remain the same distance apart regardless of whether ATP, ADP, or ADP&#x2b;Pi is bound, and that positions 555/647 are moved relative to each other and also to 533/625 in the transition state, relative to the ATP and ADP-bound states. Since 555/647 residues are toward the C-terminal, this may reflect a functional flexibility of this region relative to the core of the NBD, rather than a starkly different conformation of the NBDs</italic>.</p><p>We are not sure where the reviewer found the data for ADP and ADP&#x2b;Pi; we certainly do not report it here for 533/625. Furthermore, by focusing on 533/625, which is critiqued as a poor labeling choice in the next comment, the reviewer is selectively dismissing the data from six pairs in the NBSs. The presence of three conformational states of the NBD (now also demonstrated in lipid bilayers) is not solely based on the 555/647 pair but is confirmed by 6 spin label pairs that monitor the NBSs. If the data are considered in its entirety, the reviewer&#x2019;s scenario would also require flexibility at the NBSs that is consonant with that of the C-terminal region which by itself is evidence of tight coupling between these various regions. Furthermore, that similar distances are observed in MsbA 561 and BmrCD 555/647 strongly support the contention that the two pairs report on the rigid body movement of the NBD.</p><p><italic>In some cases the choice of position to attach probes is mystifying. For example, position 533/625, according to homology with Sav1866, is usually a large hydrophobic residue, which is buried and engaged in interactions with the C-terminal helix as well as the hydrophobic core of the core subdomain. Attachment of a probe at this position appears likely to disrupt significantly the structure at this point, as also suggested by the fact that basal and substrate-stimulated ATPase are about the same for 533/625</italic>.</p><p>We are disappointed that the reviewer finds the choices mystifying. This particular pair was selected to be structurally similar to MsbA 539, a site that was shown to fingerprint the large amplitude movement of the NBDs induced by nucleotide binding. We agree that the substitution at 533/625 is on the perturbing side. We further concur that given the marginal stimulation by substrate, it is prudent to avoid a mechanistic interpretation of this data beyond the fact that there is a large distance change upon ATP turnover and trapping that is similar to that observed in MsbA. The text has been modified to reflect this more conservative interpretation.</p><p><italic>Position 461/552 is a highly conserved leucine, buried very near the active site. It appears likely that a probe at this point would either sterically interfere with the nucleotide binding pocket or require the protein to fold non-natively at this point to accommodate the probe when nucleotide is bound at the proximal site. Again, the functional data suggest significant disruption for this probe position. The authors should discuss the possibility that probe attached to positions 461/552 could impinge on the nucleotide-binding pocket</italic>.</p><p><italic>Why were conserved buried residue positions chosen to attach probes, while in other cases far more suitable choices were made (e.g.</italic>, <italic>392/484)?</italic></p><p>The corresponding author&#x2019;s lab has always preached and practiced incorporation of spin labels at exposed positions. We also practice the use of multiple pairs (e.g., the three pairs at the NBS) to derive conclusions partly to overcome data bias from spin label pairs where unexpected perturbation is observed. For the case in point, the leucines are not buried as defined by surface accessible areas and a leucine at this position is not conserved in MsbA. The location in loop regions was an important factor in their selection. Typically loop sites are less perturbing as demonstrated from over 20 years of site directed spin labeling. While the substitutions lead to changes in ATP turnover, all three pairs that monitor the NBSs display stimulation by substrate. More importantly, the reviewer&#x2019;s argument that there may be local structural perturbations that may influence the data is refuted by the consistency between the three pairs that monitor each of the NBS. Each set of three pairs report three conformations as reflected the distance: apo, AMP-PNP bound and vanadate trapped. This multiple pair approach has been established by multiple publications from the PI&#x2019;s laboratory.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;While ATP binding, mimicked by addition of AMP-PNP</italic>, <italic>induces the formation...&#x201d;</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have interpreted their DEER data as indicating dimerisation of the NBDs upon addition of ATP to the apo state. It is difficult to conceive how the NBDs could dimerise without inducing the inward- to outward-facing switch in the NBDs, and also how having done so, hydrolysis could then induce the TMD switch. NBD dimerisation while the TMDs remained in the inward-facing conformation would require the CHs to disengage from the NBDs, in which case no ATP hydrolysis signal could be transmitted to the TMDs. This appears clear. It doesn&#x27;t seem sufficient to simply postulate &#x201c;large independent movement&#x201d; of the NBDs, when in terms of the crystal structures and the switch mechanism, such a thing appears impossible</italic>. <italic>In what structural scenario could this happen?</italic></p><p>The reviewer proposes one explanation for the lack of tight coupling between NBD and TMD &#x2013; namely the disengagement of the coupling helix (CH) from the NBD. An equally feasible explanation is that the CH interface with the NBDs is disordered to begin with and that the energy of ATP hydrolysis is required to overcome this conformational entropy. One would also imagine other speculative models but the absence of a testable hypothesis which so far has even eluded high resolution structures does not diminish from the impact and unequivocalness of the data which has now been also demonstrated in lipid bilayers.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the coupling helices (CH) are likely to have a critical role in the degree of coupling. Unraveling the structural mechanism requires high resolution structures of ABC exporters from different classes. This is well beyond the scope of this paper; but the lack of current understanding of this aspect does not constitute an argument to refute an unequivocal data set that clearly shows a level of uncoupling between the NBDs and TMDs.</p><p><italic>Surely the data show that under steady state transport conditions the degenerate NBS does not sample significantly the widely open state (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>), that the consensus NBS is predominantly within 25 &#xc5; of the fully occluded conformation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref><italic>; 5min) and the extracellular separation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>) all but never happens? As discussed above, the data for the 533/625 pair indicate that all the distance changes observed between ADP&#x2b;Vi-trapped and ATP-bound and ADP-bound states must be due to local changes, since the 533/625 pair does not change between these states. 515/607 are located on the D-helix, 440/532 on the &#x03B1;3-4 loop, and 441/348 on the A-loop. These positions have been found in MD simulations to be highly flexible, undergoing significant (ie &#x3e;10 &#xc5;) changes while the NBDs remain closed at one NBS. The picture that emerges from the present data is similar to that for P-gp in Verhalen et al, (2012), where the protein doesn&#x27;t sample the widely apart conformation to any significant extent during normal cycling</italic>.</p><p>We disagree with the statement &#x201c;all but never happens&#x201d;. There is a measurable reduction in the population of inward-facing conformation but the equilibrium still favors this conformations. The reviewer reiterates his/her exclusive confidence in the 533/625 pair that he/she has critiqued as a &#x201c;mystifying&#x201d; choice for label attachment.</p><p>On the one hand, the reviewer argues against using the 533/625 pair because of its effects on function yet attempts here to use it as an anchor overriding three different sets of pairs that directly monitor the NBSs. The idea that one of the NBS remains closed is refuted by the 3 pairs monitoring it.</p><p>Again in this comment, the reviewer uses Pgp studies (Verhalen et al.) to interpret data obtained in an ABC heterodimer. Verhalen et al. exclusively use sites in the C-terminal region of the NBDs that the author roundly dismisses for 555/647. This is another example of the mechanistic reductionism that percolates the review and is not supported by direct data in the literature.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;No other short distance component is detected as would be expected if the NBS were structurally asymmetric...</italic>&#x201d;</p><p><italic>For the single mutant 350, the distance of 67 &#xc5; under nucleotide-bound conditions (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Fig. 6</italic></xref> <italic>Suppl 2) is some 18 &#xc5; longer than the C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance between the residue pair in the closed NBD crystal structure. Given a C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance between 350-471 of 20 &#xc5; in the closed state, the middle peak distance in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>of 53 &#xc5;, when a similar correction of 18 &#xc5; is applied, comes to a C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distance of 35 &#xc5;. This is an increase of 15 &#xc5;. Since rotations of the core subdomain of this magnitude have been observed in MD simulations of the closed Sav1866 NBD dimer, these results do not preclude the possibility that the intermediate distance in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>does not represent a semi-open asymmetric state of the NBD dimer. The peak distances for the single mutants do not match the peak distances in the double mutants. This should be explained</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct on the origin of the deviation of the 350/350 distance but mistaken in applying the correction to the 350/471 distance. Given the orientation of the labels in opposite directions along the interspin vector, the approximately 15 &#xc5; deviation is expected at symmetry-related pair 350/350. The deviation at 471 is smaller of the order of 10 &#xc5; also consistent with the expected orientation of the labels. Where the reviewer argument fails is in arbitrarily applying the 18&#xc5; correction to the 350/470 pair. The correction to be applied should reflect the expected orientation of the labels that in this case is closer to 10 &#xc5;.</p><p>More importantly, if as the reviewer contends, there is a semi open asymmetric state of one of the NBS that contribute to the middle distance component, then the ratio of the short distance component to the intermediate will be drastically different. Specifically d1 should be being appreciably smaller than the d2&#x2b;d3 peak. Experimentally, the 1:2 ratio reflects of the geometry of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> where the two NBSs are structurally symmetric.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;Thus, we conclude that the two NBSs are structurally equivalent during MsbA ATPase cycle</italic>.<italic>&#x201d;</italic></p><p><italic>This is not sustained. Clearly, it is possible that the broad peak for the longest distance in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>in fact represents the combined signals for the longer distance in a semi-open dimer in which one core subdomain is rotated open (downward away from the ICLs and outward from the opposite helical subdomain) by a distance of around 15 &#xc5;. This possibility should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the Apo MsbA structure is asymmetric vis a vis NBSs. The statement should exclusively refer to the nucleotide bound state. It has been edited to be more precise.</p><p><italic>For the detection of the TMD conformational changes, why were not equivalently located residues as those used for BmrACD used? Residue 158 appears to be located within the membrane. Also, given that the probes attached to position 158 would clearly point away from each other, the DEER distance for the outward-facing state is only around 8 &#xc5; greater, whereas as discussed above, additional distances added by the probe, according to the authors&#x27; interpretation, reached over 15 &#xc5;. In the inward-facing structure of MsbA</italic>, <italic>C&#x03B1;-C&#x03B1; distances for residue 158 are around 40 &#xc5;, exactly the same as in the outward-facing conformation. Why was this position chosen? Why does it change when the structures predict it doesn&#x27;t? Does this not mean the results are at odds with the mechanistic interpretation derived from the structures?</italic></p><p>Although this comment is not relevant to the findings of the manuscript, we will respond to it since it contains erroneous statements. For the record, residue 96 of BmrCD in the TMD is structurally equivalent to MsbA 103 so the comment is not entirely precise in regards to TMD conformational changes. Furthermore, the reviewer is incorrect in asserting that 158 &#x201c;has exactly the same distance&#x201d; in the two structures. In fact, a distance change of about 4 &#xc5; is expected from the crystal structures. We have noted in the previous papers that our data suggest a larger conformational change in the extracellular side of MsbA.</p><p>With this in mind, it is not clear to us why the amplitude of the distance change relevant here. Residue 158 is not used for direct comparison with BmrCD. The points it reinforces are: 1) that ATP binding is the power stroke and 2) that under turnover conditions MsbA favors the outward-facing conformation.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;In contrast to BmrCD, the equilibrium distinctly favors an outward-facing conformation.</italic>&#x201d;</p><p><italic>How do the authors draw this conclusion?</italic></p><p>Under ATP turnover conditions, we observe a large population of outward-facing MsbA. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> 103 and 158 panels<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>&#x201c;We propose that the distinct catalytic mechanism of heterodimers requires a less efficient coupling between the NBD and TMD, a &#x27;conformational leak&#x27;, to enable NBD movement without transmission to the TMDs.</italic>&#x201d;</p><p><italic>This proposal is fine as proposals go, but it suggests that heterodimers operate with a different or additional minor(?) structural conformational change in the non-canonical NBD than in homodimers, and that this change is not transmitted to the TMDs. Since not all movements of ABC NBDs could possibly be transmitted to the TMDs, except in a concerted and allosteric &#x27;global&#x27; sense, the use of the term &#x27;conformational leak&#x27; is difficult to sustain without further explanation? How can this be construed as a mechanistic step in heterodimers</italic>, <italic>yet be completely absent in homodimers?</italic></p><p>We do not suggest that the conformational change at the NBD is not transmitted to the TMD. We suggest that such transmission requires ATP hydrolysis. The &#x201c;conformational leak&#x201d; refers to the tightness of the coupling between the NBDs and TMDs. The distinct mechanistic step is upon ATP binding. The &#x201c;conformational leak&#x201d; is necessitated by the finding that the hydrolysis step is the power stroke in heterodimers while the ATP binding step is the power stroke for homodimers. This is clearly stated in the description of the model for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We interpret this comment in the context of the final comment which highlights the reviewer&#x2019;s adherence to the notion that all ABC transporters must employ the same conformational cycle, a view that is not supported by any explicit data in the literature.</p><p><italic>&#x201c;Our results can be framed in a model of how asymmetric ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs drive transition of the TMDs between inward- and outward-facing conformations (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>).</italic>&#x201d;</p><p><italic>Unfortunately the points above significantly blunt the force of this finding; and it is difficult to sustain this model without clarification of the data.

We conclude from the comparative analysis of BmrCD and MsbA conformational cycles that the controversy regarding NBD disengagement versus constant contact (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><italic>George and Jones, 2012</italic></xref><italic>) is a consequence of extrapolation of models between mechanistically distinct classes of ABC exporters.</italic>&#x201d;</p><p><italic>If I read the extract of text here and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>(A&#x26;B) correctly, the authors seem to be concluding that the mechanisms for ABC heterodimers and homodimers are different, a conclusion that I find extraordinary. Given that heterodimers have canonical and non-canonical ATP catalytic sites and homodimers have dual canonical sites, I take it that the authors are drawing a vast distinction between ATP binding, and very slow hydrolysis, in non-canonical sites, with rapid ATP hydrolysis in canonical sites, and that this separates the mechanistic pathways of in hetero- and homodimers as depicted in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>. The representation of heterodimers as proceeding via a so-called &#x201c;constant contact&#x201d; model and homodimers by the so-called Switch model defies credibility in such a closely related family of transporters and for which the NBDs are the most highly conserved domains. This needs to be explained and justified in clear detail</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the contrast between our quoted text and the reviewer&#x2019;s rebuttal captures the crux of this review. The statement that our model &#x201c;defies credibility&#x201d; reflects a preconceived notion that all ABC transporters (exporters?) must share a common conformational cycle. There is simply no evidence for this contention. It is reminiscent of the early dogmatic view that ABC exporters and ABC importers must have a common mechanism, a dogma that is now all but debunked. We surmise that holding on to dogmas in the face of unequivocal data is what defies credibility. We anticipate that the clarifications and explanations will convince the reviewer of the veracity of our interpretation of the DEER data, a technique that is extensively used in the laboratory.</p></body></sub-article></article>
