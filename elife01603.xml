activity and contractility of myofilaments. Here, we show that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. EMD 57033-binding protects myosin against heat stress and thermal denaturation. In the presence of EMD 57033, ATP hydrolysis, coupling between actin and nucleotide binding sites, and actin affinity in the presence of ATP are increased more than 10-fold. Addition of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin is followed by refolding and reactivation of ATPase and motile activities. In heat-stressed cardiomyocytes expression of the stress-marker atrial natriuretic peptide is suppressed by EMD 57033. Thus, EMD 57033 displays a much wider spectrum of activities than those previously associated with small, drug-like compounds. Allosteric effectors that mediate refolding and enhance enzymatic function have the potential to improve the treatment of heart failure, myopathies, and protein misfolding diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01603.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01603.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01603.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our muscles contain large numbers of &#x2018;motor proteins&#x2019; called myosins. To contract a muscle, many myosin molecules expend energy to &#x2018;walk&#x2019; along a filament made from another molecule, called actin, and generate a pulling force. Like other proteins, myosins must fold into the correct shape to work, but high temperatures or other types of stress can disrupt their ability to adopt or maintain the correct shape. Misfolding of myosins, for example, can result in muscular diseases, including those that affect the heart; so there is an ongoing effort to find compounds that can stabilize protein folding and treat these diseases.</p><p>The small molecule EMD 57033 was discovered over 20 years ago, and its ability to increase the strength of muscle contractions suggested that it could be used to treat chronic heart failure, but the risk of side effects limited its clinical use. The effectiveness of other compounds that improve cardiac muscle function is still routinely compared to EMD 57033, however the exact mechanism responsible for its effect on muscle tissue remained unknown.</p><p>Now Radke, Taft et al. have identified the part of the myosin protein that EMD 57033 binds to, and shown how this activates muscle contraction. The experiments also, unexpectedly, revealed that EMD 57033 is able to convert misfolded myosin back into the fully functional form. By revealing this refolding effect, the findings of Radtke, Taft et al. suggest that similar small molecules could be used as drugs for the treatment of protein misfolding diseases, muscular diseases, and heart failure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01603.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01603.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>pharmacological chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Dictyostelium</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>European Commission</funding-source><award-id>228971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manstein</surname><given-names>Dietmar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</funding-source><award-id>EXC62/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilfiker-Kleiner</surname><given-names>Denise</given-names></name><name><surname>Manstein</surname><given-names>Dietmar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>0.7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The small molecule EMD 57033 is one of a new class of pharmacological chaperones that stabilize, enhance the activity of, and correct stress-induced misfolding of myosin proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian cells typically produce in excess of 10,000 different proteins displaying enzymatic activities. To retain the conformational flexibility required for their catalytic function, most of these enzymes are only marginally thermodynamically stable. Their &#x2018;native state&#x2019; corresponds to an ensemble of conformers sharing closely related three-dimensional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartlett and Radford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>). External stress brought about by changes in pH, temperature, ionic strength, and the composition and concentration of small-molecule ligands affects the transition to the denatured state. The denatured state is characterized by the loss of enzymatic activity and can be described as an ensemble of states with high conformational entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anfinsen and Scheraga, 1975</xref>). Denatured enzyme molecules are more likely to be affected by adsorption, aggregation, precipitation, and proteolysis. At the cellular level, their aggregation with one another or with properly functioning proteins leads to deleterious consequences. Their accumulation can interfere with proteasome function, disrupt normal cellular processes by binding critical cell-signaling and cell-trafficking molecules, and trigger signals that result in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Willis and Patterson, 2013</xref>). The resulting proteotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of proteinopathies such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, various forms of amyloidosis, and Alzheimer&#x2019;s and Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. Elaborate cellular systems for the maintenance of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) have evolved to prevent the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein aggregates. These comprise approximately 200 general and specialized chaperone components and 600 ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy system components that support protein folding, refolding of stress-denatured enzymes, disaggregation, and proteolytic degradation of irreversibly misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Nalepa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Myosins are amongst the most abundant proteins in our body. In addition to their role as molecular motors driving the stiffening and contraction of muscles, they contribute to a wide range of functions. In the case of myosin, the negative consequences of misfolding are amplified by the formation of roadblock-like, strongly-bound complexes with their actin filament tracks. Aberrant myosin activity and proteostasis contribute to hereditary skeletal myopathies, cardiomyopathies, and various disorders of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Oldfors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Walsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Getty and Pearce, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Getty et al., 2011</xref>). In the course of investigations to identify small-molecule ligands that stabilize myosin against thermal denaturation, we identified the thiadiazinone derivative EMD 57033 as a potent mediator of myosin folding. EMD 57033 is the positive optical isomer of the racemate EMD 53998. The negative isomer, EMD 57439, acts as a potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambassi et al., 1993</xref>). EMD 57033 displays only minimal phosphodiesterase III inhibitory effects and has been described to act both as Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> sensitizer and activator of the actomyosin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beier et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferroni et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambassi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Solaro et al., 1993</xref>). Studies with EMD 57033 performed in dogs, with heart failure induced through long-term tachycardia pacing, show potent positive inotropic effects, reduced oxygen cost of contraction, and enhanced diastolic chamber performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Senzaki et al., 2000</xref>). It has been postulated that the observed Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> sensitization is closely linked to EMD 57033-induced changes in myosin cross-bridge kinetics that interfere with normal troponin&#x2013;tropomyosin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Solaro et al., 1993</xref>). Here, we provide evidence indicating that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain near the base of the lever arm. In addition to increasing motility, force production, and thermal stability of native myosin, binding of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated myosin induces refolding and reactivation of ATPase activity and motility. Our findings demonstrate that small molecules such as EMD 57033 can stabilize, enhance the activity of and correct stress-associated misfolding of globular enzymes. Pharmacological chaperones with the activity profile of EMD 57033 open the door to a new class of therapeutic drugs and the production of commercially viable biosensors, as described in the &#x2018;Discussion&#x2019;.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>EMD 57033 acts as an allosteric activator of the myosin motor</title><p>We used microscale thermophoresis to show that EMD 57033 binds purified &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin S1 with a stoichiometry of one molecule of EMD 57033 per myosin head with an affinity of 7.3 &#xb1; 1.9 &#xb5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Myosin constructs that bind EMD 57033 display increased basal and actin-activated ATPase activity in the presence of the compound. The most potent interaction was observed with &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin with half-maximal activation (AC<sub>50</sub>) observed at 7.0 &#xb1; 1.5 &#xb5;M EMD 57033 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The activation of skeletal muscle myosin-2 and <italic>Dd</italic> myosin-5 is twofold and fivefold weaker. Neither binding nor activation was observed for the (&#x2212;)-enantiomer EMD 57439 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The consequences of EMD 57033 binding on the turnover of ATP by actin-activated &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin were followed in single-turnover experiments. Using the extrinsic fluorescence probe 2&#x2019;-/3&#x2019;-O-(N&#x2019;-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP (mantATP) instead of ATP as substrate, we observed signal changes that can be attributed to three phases. The initial fast rise of fluorescence reflects the binding of the ATP analogue to the myosin active site, the following plateau phase monitors the duration of the hydrolysis reaction, and the third phase, corresponding to a decrease in fluorescence signal intensity, monitors the rate of product release. In the presence of EMD 57033, we observed an approximately twofold net increase in the rate of ATP turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01603.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EMD 57033 binds to the myosin motor domain and activates ATPase and motor activities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Direct interaction study between fluorescently labeled &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin S1, <italic>Dd</italic> myosin-2 motor domain, and <italic>Dd</italic> myosin-1C motor domain and EMD 57033.

The observed deviation results from incomplete folding, the presence of impurities, and the stress-induced partial loss of function during purification and storage. In the case of myosin, the amplitude of the fast rise in fluorescence intensity that follows binding of mantATP can be used to estimate the fraction of functional protein by active site titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Tsiavaliaris et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the results of active site titrations for four typical preparations of &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin and a <italic>Dd</italic> myosin-2 motor domain construct. Dependent on the type of myosin, purification conditions, and length of storage, the fraction of active myosin heads varies between 32% and 92%. The fraction of active sites increased to 87&#x2013;98% for the same enzyme preparations following the addition of EMD 57033. The increase in the number of binding-competent active sites is followed by a correlated increase in myosin ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In addition to the apparent conversion of inactive to catalytically competent myosin, ATPase activities measured in the presence of EMD 57033 correlate with the total number of myosin heads rather than the initial number of active myosin heads. Moreover, the measured ATPase activities exceed the values expected for a 100% active population of myosin heads by 30&#x2013;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To probe the effect of EMD 57033 on myosin motor activity, we performed in vitro motility assays. The sliding velocity of actin filaments increased 1.8-fold for &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and 1.6-fold for a <italic>Dd</italic> myosin-2 motor domain construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the fraction of moving filaments increased from &#x3c;75% to &#x3e;95%. To examine whether EMD 57033 affects force production by &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin as well, we performed frictional loading experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenberg and Moore, 2010</xref>). In initial experiments, we determined the minimal concentration of &#x3b1;-actinin molecules that generate sufficient load to stall the movement of actin filaments for a given surface density of myosin heads. In the presence of EMD 57033, the &#x3b1;-actinin concentration required to stall filament movement increased from 8 &#xb5;g/ml to &#x2265;12 &#xb5;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we generated in vitro motility flow cells with actin filaments held at stall force. The addition of 25 &#x3bc;M EMD 57033 to these flow cells restarts filament movement. The time-dependence of the recovery of motile activity is best fit by a hyperbola. A plateau value of 0.4 &#x3bc;m s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> is reached after more than 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Localization of the EMD 57033 binding pocket</title><p>Steady-state kinetic assays performed in the absence and the presence of EMD 57033 indicate an allosteric mode of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). The binding site of EMD 57033 in the human &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin motor domain was further defined by molecular docking experiments in combination with direct binding studies using myosin motor domain constructs with alterations in the predicted binding region. Initial blind docking to homology models of the &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin motor domain in the post-rigor state indicated preferred binding of the drug to a region near the small N-terminal, SH3-like &#x3b2;barrel subdomain. Important contacts are predicted to involve the SH3-like subdomain (residues 34&#x2013;72) and two &#x3b1;-helices (residues 20&#x2013;28 and 98&#x2013;111). The mode of binding and the orientation of EMD 57033 in this pocket were further analyzed using a flexible, targeted docking procedure. Rearrangements in the side chains of residues Arg29 and Lys34 are predicted to bring these two amino acids into the close vicinity of polar groups in EMD 57033. The identified binding pocket exhibits a Y shape, supporting two slightly different clusters of binding poses of EMD 57033 with predicted binding free energies in the range of &#x2212;11 to &#x2212;12 kcal mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The sets of binding poses differ mainly in the orientation of the dimethylated catechol group, occupying either of the two possible branches of the Y, while the thiadiazinone moiety appears little affected and resides in the root of the Y shaped cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Potential residues involved in the binding of the thiadiazinone and tetrahydroquinoline moieties of the compound include Arg23, Asp85, Lys86, Asp107, Arg108, and Ser111. The dimethylated catechol moiety is mainly bound by residues Lys34, Lys48, and Gln79, and thus, interacts with the SH3-like &#x3b2;-barrel. The contribution of residues from the SH3-like &#x3b2;-barrel to EMD 57033 binding is in good agreement with our observation that all class-1 myosins tested, which lack this subdomain, fail to bind EMD 57033 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To verify that the SH3-like &#x3b2;-barrel is necessary to mediate EMD 57033 binding, we performed direct binding, ATPase, and in vitro motility assays with <italic>Dd</italic> myosin-2 &#x394;SH3, a recombinant motor domain construct that lacks this subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita-Becker et al., 2006</xref>).

The effect of EMD 57033 on individual steps of the ATPase cycle of &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin was analyzed with the help of transient kinetic measurements and evaluated according to the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Scheme 1. Upon addition of 25 &#xb5;M EMD 57033 to &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin, we observed a 1.6-fold increase in k<sub>cat</sub>, the maximum rate of ATP turnover, and a 10-fold decrease in K<sub>M(actin)</sub>, the F-actin concentration necessary for half-maximal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The extent to which coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites is improved in the presence of EMD 57033 is indicated by the resulting 16-fold increase in the apparent second-order rate constant (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M(actin)</sub>) for the actin-activated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Fast mixing of excess ATP with &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin results in an increase of the protein&#x2019;s intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The kinetic model predicts the double exponential &#x2018;behavior&#x2019; of the observed transients to be associated with two discrete processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The fast process corresponds to the binding of ATP to the active site. The rate of the slow process saturates at ATP concentrations above 100 &#xb5;M and can be attributed to the ATP hydrolysis step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deacon et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, EMD 57033 triggers a 3.4-fold increase in the second order rate constant for ATP binding (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>k</italic><sub><italic>&#x2b;2</italic></sub>), a 3.8-fold increase in the rate of the subsequent conformational change (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>&#x2b;2</italic></sub>), and a 12.9-fold increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>&#x2b;3</italic></sub> <italic>&#x2b; k</italic><sub><italic>&#x2212;3</italic></sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Phosphate release is the rate-limiting step of the &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin actin-activated ATPase cycle. It can be monitored by the fluorescence increase that is associated with the much faster binding of phosphate to the A197C mutant of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phosphate binding protein, labeled at Cys197 with the thiol reactive coumarin dye MDCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brune et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

The fraction of myosin that is able to bind mantATP drops to below 32% when the temperature is raised to 49&#xb0;C for more than 5 min. Incubation for 10 min at 51&#xb0;C removes the myosin completely and irreversibly from the soluble fraction. Preincubation of the myosin with 25 &#x3bc;M EMD 57033 before exposure to heat-stress prevents precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, insert). Moreover, based on the amplitude of the rise in mantATP fluorescence, the competence of &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin to bind nucleotide is preserved to more than 91% after 5-min incubation at 49&#xb0;C and to approximately 82% after 10-min incubation at 49&#xb0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The apparent large reduction in the rate of mantATP binding and the extended plateau phase suggest that the observed transients report a rate-limiting step in the refolding of the &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin motor rather than the rate of nucleotide binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for comparison). This view is supported by experiments that monitor the recovery of basal activity over a 2 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To obtain more detailed information about the kinetics of the EMD 57033-mediated refolding reaction, we performed three sets of experiments recording the time and concentration dependence of EMD 57033-mediated increases in the fraction of myosin molecules that are able to undergo nucleotide induced conformational changes, hydrolyze ATP, and produce movement in the in vitro motility assay.</p><p>Changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence are tightly linked to ATP binding and ATP-induced conformational changes in the myosin motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Batra and Manstein, 1999</xref>). Therefore, the progress of the refolding reaction can be estimated by incubating heat-inactivated &#x3b2;-cardiac myosin with EMD 57033 and recording the change in intrinsic protein fluorescence that follows the addition of substoichiometric amounts of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and excess ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) at predefined time points over the next two hours.

Refolding and reactivation of ATPase activity and motility were measured in the presence of 10&#x2013;100 &#x3bc;M EMD 57033. In each experimental setting the data obtained for a specific EMD 57033 concentration were best fit by hyperbolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).

EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. The site appears to be close to the site where cardiac myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil is predicted to bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malik et al., 2011</xref>). The greater isoform specificity of omecamtiv mecarbil and preliminary results with other compounds suggest that it is feasible to identify compounds with improved properties for the treatment of aberrant myosin motor activity that are derived from thiadiazinone derivatives and unrelated scaffolds. The efficacy of the resulting drugs may be further enhanced by combining them with drugs that increase the abundance and activity of cellular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Willis and Patterson, 2013</xref>). The actin-affinity of cardiac &#x3b2;-myosin and the coupling efficiency between motor domain and actin filament are increased in the presence of saturating concentrations of EMD 57033. The selective shortening of the lifetime of weakly bound states and the associated increase in the fraction of strongly bound motor domains explain the leftwards shift of the force&#x2013;pCa relation and the reduced oxygen cost of contractility observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Solaro et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kraft and Brenner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Senzaki et al., 2000</xref>).

The resulting proteotoxicity is frequently of equal or greater importance for the clinical expression of the associated disease states as the direct, mutation-induced loss in enzymatic activity. Misfolded proteins including mutation-induced misfolded myosins are known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The role of misfolded proteins in the development of numerous other disorders such as type-2 diabetes and heart failure has become evident in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Willis and Patterson, 2013</xref>). Moreover, cardiac dysfunction is a frequent complication associated with elevated body temperature due to fever or hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marijon et al., 2012</xref>). It is well known that pathophysiologic alterations of the heart are associated with a decrease in &#x3b1;-MHC and an increase in &#x3b2;-MHC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mercadier et al., 1983</xref>). This is normally associated with an increase in ANP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Aggeli et al., 2002</xref>). In fact, ANP levels in the myocardium are greatly augmented in patients with congestive heart failure and animal models of ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ogawa et al., 1995</xref>). Such changes are indicative of re-expression of a fetal gene expression program, as it is induced by the &#x3b1;-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilfiker-Kleiner et al., 2006</xref>). Physiological stress such as exercise induces a shift towards &#x3b1;-cardiac MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Allen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Baldwin and Haddad, 2001</xref>). EMD 57033 induces hypertrophic growth under normothermic conditions that involves a reduction in &#x3b2;-MHC without affecting &#x3b1;-cardiac MHC and thereby changes in the transcriptional regulation that are clearly distinct from phenylephrine-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilfiker-Kleiner et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, EMD 57033 appears to promote a more physiological type of hypertrophy. This notion is further supported by the observation that ANP expression is not induced in the presence of EMD 57033. In addition, the observed reduction of ANP expression in heat-treated cardiomyocytes suggests that EMD 57033-mediates a reduction in cellular stress responses by stabilizing and refolding denatured MHC proteins.</p><p>Our results provide evidence for the refolding effect exerted by a small drug-like molecule on a complex protein such as myosin. It remains to be shown whether the refolding activity is shared by other compounds binding to the same region of myosin and to what extent it can be separated from the activation of chemomechanical activity. Small chemical compounds with similar activity profile but increased specificity for their target protein have the potential to improve the treatment of protein misfolding diseases, myopathies, and heart failure.</p><p>The functionalization of biohybrid devices that exploit actomyosin-based cargo transport for molecular diagnostics and other nanotechnological applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Amrute-Nayak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Persson et al., 2013</xref>) is another area that will certainly benefit from the use of EMD 57033 and the development of compounds that stabilize their target proteins against stress-induced denaturation, precipitation, and proteolytic degradation.

This mantATP concentration defines the actual concentration of active myosin heads in the respective protein preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Steady-state kinetics</title><p>Basal and actin-activated Mg<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-ATPase activities were measured using the NADH-coupled assay described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Furch et al., 1998</xref>) adapted for higher throughput screens for a temperature controlled plate reader (Multiscan FC, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 25&#xb0;C. EMD 57033 was added to the reaction mixture in the absence of nucleotide and incubated before the reaction was started by the addition of ATP. Control measurements were carried out in the absence of drug, as well as in the presence of according concentrations of the non-binding (&#x2212;)-enantiomer EMD 57439 to account for possible absorption effects. Each reaction mixture including the controls contained 2.5% DMSO that was used as solvent for EMD 57033. Data points are mean values from 3 to 5 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>In vitro motility assay</title><p>Actin-sliding motility was performed at 20&#xb0;C using an Olympus IX81 (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) inverted fluorescence microscope as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fujita-Becker et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript entitled &#x201c;Small Molecule-mediated Refolding and Activation of Myosin Motor Function&#x201d; by Radke et al. is a very interesting paper worthy of serious consideration for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. While one can quibble with a few of the experiments or their description in this paper, collectively the data provide compelling evidence for the hypothesis that EMD 57033 is a pharmacologic chaperone that stabilizes, enhances the activity of, and corrects stress-associated misfolding of a subset of members of the myosin family comprising a SH3-like Beta barrel domain. I am not aware of another pharmacologic chaperone that can mediate refolding and gain of enhanced function from a denatured protein like EMD 57033 can with myosin.</p><p>1) Generally the experiments are very well executed. What is not clear from the text or the associated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d&#x2013;e</xref> is whether EMD 57033 was added after the four typical preparations of beta-cardiac myosin (affording 32&#x2013;90% activity) or whether it was present during the preparations leading to 87&#x2013;98% activity. The implication of the text is that the 32-90% activity was converted to 87&#x2013;98% activity by adding EMD 57033 after misfolding, i.e., that EMD 57033 mediated activation and conversion of inactive to catalytically hyperactive myosin. Please clarify these points in the text.</p><p>2) What is missing in the Abstract is a concluding sentence focusing on what the novel pharmacologic application would be for this unique pharmacologic chaperone-what can it be used for and why it is important. My impression is that it could be used to treat heart disease. If so, say so, or otherwise explain its importance.</p><p>3) The Discussion needs a further explanation of the potential medical uses of this very interesting pharmacologic chaperone and a further explanation of how the authors anticipate the application.</p><p>4) The claim that the authors have identified the site that EMD 57033 binds to (the pocket between the lever arm and small N-terminal, SH3-like barrel subdomain) is based mainly on the lack of activation of sliding velocity by EMD 57033 when the SH3 domain is deleted from the protein and on molecular docking studies. In the absence of a co-crystal structure, I would prefer to see some point mutations of myosin made that eliminate key residues predicted to interact with EMD 57033 in the SH3-like domain or binding competition assays with omecamtiv since the authors mention the binding site for this molecule is nearby. While it would be valuable to see more evidence supporting the actual binding site, especially for the development of improved PCs or to accurately study the MOA of these molecules, I think it would be sufficient to state that the results support this site as the potential binding site, but further confirmation is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01603.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Generally the experiments are very well executed.

My impression is that it could be used to treat heart disease. If so, say so, or otherwise explain its importance</italic>.</p><p>We added the following to the end of the Abstract: &#x201c;Thus, EMD 57033 displays a much wider spectrum of activities than those previously associated with small, drug-like compounds. Allosteric effectors that mediate refolding and enhance enzymatic function have the potential to improve the treatment of heart failure, myopathies, and protein misfolding diseases.&#x201d;</p><p><italic>3) The Discussion needs a further explanation of the potential medical uses of this very interesting pharmacologic chaperone and a further explanation of how the authors anticipate the application</italic>.</p><p>We changed the concluding part of the Discussion:</p><p>&#x201c;Our results provide evidence for the refolding effect exerted by a small drug-like molecule on a complex protein such as myosin. It remains to be shown whether the refolding activity is shared by other compounds binding to the same region of myosin and to what extent it can be separated from the activation of chemomechanical activity. Small chemical compounds with similar activity profile but increased specificity for their target protein have the potential to improve the treatment of protein misfolding diseases, myopathies and heart failure.</p><p>The functionalization of biohybrid devices that exploit actomyosin-based cargo transport for molecular diagnostics and other nanotechnological applications [Amrute-Nayak et al; Lard et al; Persson et al] is another area that will certainly benefit from the use of EMD 57033 and the development of compounds that stabilize their target proteins against stress-induced denaturation, precipitation, and proteolytic degradation. The effective and simple long-term storage of chip-based nanobiosensors, where actomyosin-driven transport substitutes microfluidics and forms the basis for novel detection schemes, is a precondition for the commercial viability of such devices. The addition of EMD 57033 extends the shelf life of protein-functionalized surfaces from a couple of hours to several months, making the widespread and routine use of biohybrid devices feasible.&#x201d;</p><p><italic>4) The claim that the authors have identified the site that EMD 57033 binds to (the pocket between the lever arm and small N-terminal, SH3-like barrel subdomain) is based mainly on the lack of activation of sliding velocity by EMD 57033 when the SH3 domain is deleted from the protein and on molecular docking studies.
