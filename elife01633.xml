As high school students, we were judged by exam results, grade-point averages or standardized test scores. Later, from graduate school onwards, we are mostly evaluated according to the quality of our research. Performing well in such evaluations is essential for anyone who wants to advance in a research environment, so it is crucial that these assessments are performed in a way that is fair and transparent.</p><p>The system of evaluation and assessment places substantial pressure on early career researchers, especially when looking for a fellowship or a tenure-track position in a university or research institute. It is not uncommon for job or fellowship announcements to attract hundreds of applications. Many scientists, especially those in the early stages of their career, believe that their chances of succeeding (or even getting an interview) depend primarily on the impact factors of the journals in which they have published. This is more true in some institutions and countries than in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ching, 2013</xref>). Although more and more funders and institutions are emphasizing that the intrinsic quality of the research is what really matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">DORA, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Schekman and Patterson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Schmid, 2013</xref>), too many scientists still have an unhealthy obsession with getting published in the rarefied world of &#x2018;top-tier&#x2019; journals that are characterized by review processes and acceptance policies that often appear opaque and capricious.</p><p>And the pressure does not go away after you have landed a tenure-track position, because the next challenges are to secure grant money and to convince your new colleagues that you deserve tenure. (Plus you have to show that you are a good colleague). Again, despite what senior investigators tell them and what the grant-awarding agencies say, many pre-tenure researchers believe that the number of papers in top-tier journals is the key to professional success and happiness. It is worth repeating here that the journal impact factor was never intended to be a measure of the quality of individual research papers: it was designed as a tool for comparing journals (and even then it has certain limitations), and scientists themselves are largely to blame for allowing it to influence decisions about hiring and promotion to the extent that it does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Curry, 2012</xref>).</p><p>At <italic>eLife</italic>, we recognize these pressures and have introduced a number of measures for the benefit of our colleagues who are in the early stages of their careers. First, we encourage corresponding authors who do not have tenure to mention this in their cover letter. The Senior Editor who handles the manuscript will take this into account when deciding whether or not it merits in-depth peer review by a Reviewing Editor and one or more external referees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Schekman et al, 2013a</xref>): as a result, a higher-than-average percentage of manuscripts from early career authors receive in-depth peer review. However, this does not mean that manuscripts from early career authors are more likely to be accepted than those from more established investigators. Rather, it means that early career authors are more likely to receive (and benefit from) the sort of considered, in-depth feedback from referees that will help them to improve the manuscript and increase its chances of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> (or a different journal). And if the Senior Editor decides that a manuscript from an early career researcher should not be sent for in-depth peer review, the authors will in general receive more than just a standard rejection letter.</p><p>Second, we recognize that graduate students and postdocs require letters of recommendation when they are applying for jobs and fellowships. Therefore, the Senior Editors of <italic>eLife</italic> have agreed to write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the first author in support of job or fellowship applications, and many authors have requested and received such letters.</p><disp-quote><p>The Senior Editors of <italic>eLife</italic> have agreed to write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the first author in support of job or fellowship applications.</p></disp-quote><p>In a new effort, we are identifying a small number of particularly outstanding <italic>eLife</italic> Research Articles by early career researchers and inviting the first or corresponding author on each article to give a presentation at a meeting organized by one of the three agencies that sponsor the journal (the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust). Since most <italic>eLife</italic> authors are not funded by these agencies, this initiative gives these early career researchers a valuable opportunity to publicize and discuss their work with audiences that will include many leading researchers in their field.
