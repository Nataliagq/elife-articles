In an effort to identify the genes and mechanisms that are involved in this regeneration process, researchers often perform experiments on relatively simple organisms or systems. These experiments frequently involve the amputation of specific cells or organs so the researchers can observe and manipulate the events that occur during the subsequent regeneration.</p><p>One such model organism is the fruit-fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Inside the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva are structures called imaginal discs, which are precursors to parts of the outer cuticle of the adult fly. Each imaginal disc contains two main boundaries, dividing it into anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral compartments: posterior cells, for example, express a gene called <italic>engrailed</italic> to produce the relevant protein, whereas anterior cells do not; likewise, the gene <italic>apterous</italic> is expressed in dorsal cells but not ventral cells. These genes, <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>apterous</italic>, are the key factors that determine the developmental features&#x2013;and hence the identity&#x2014;of the posterior and the dorsal cells respectively.</p><p>Herrera and Morata investigated how cells regenerate when parts of the imaginal disc are destroyed, using a genetic technique that causes high levels of programmed cell death in either the posterior or the dorsal compartments of the disc.</p><p>Destroying most of the cells in either of these compartments in the imaginal disc leads to a temporary breakdown of the corresponding boundary, which is then rapidly reconstructed. During this reconstruction process, some of the imaginal disc cells are reprogrammed: for example, if the cells in the posterior compartment are destroyed, some anterior cells take on a posterior identity. This reprogramming occurs because the cell destruction disrupts the way that the expression of genes such as <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>apterous</italic> is controlled by other genes.</p><p>Neighboring cells can also control gene expression, and therefore cell identity. Cells that express <italic>engrailed</italic>, for example, cause their neighbors to express <italic>engrailed</italic> too. This process is likely to involve group interactions that might help the distinct compartments in the imaginal disc to form by ensuring that adjacent cells develop in the same way. Similar processes may also occur as part of the normal development of organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01831.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01831.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>imaginal discs</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>cell reprogramming</kwd><kwd>compartment boundaries</kwd><kwd>engrailed</kwd><kwd>cell identity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>Human Frontier Science Program    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef identification ID: </ext-link> <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</named-content></funding-source><award-id>RPG0016/2010-C104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morata</surname><given-names>Gin&#xe9;s</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain</funding-source><award-id>BFU2008-03196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morata</surname><given-names>Gin&#xe9;s</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source>JAE-Predoc fellowship - Ministerio de Econom&#xed;a y Competitividad of Spain</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrera</surname><given-names>Salvador C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>0.7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The reconstruction of damaged structures during regeneration requires cell reprogramming mediated by the up regulation of the JNK pathway and the transient debilitation of the epigenetic control mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regeneration is a classical problem in developmental biology. The cells involved have to undergo a developmental reprogramming so that they acquire the new cell identities necessary to regenerate a lost organ or a damaged tissue. In the classical example of the regeneration of an amputated amphibian limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>), proximal cells have to generate new cells with different&#x2014;distal&#x2014;identity. Very little is known about the phenomena and mechanisms behind this developmental reprogramming. We are investigating this problem using the compartments of <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs as a model system for regeneration.</p><p>The subdivision into lineage blocks, termed compartments, is a principal feature of the organization of the body of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morata &#x26; Lawrence, 1977</xref>). The earliest compartmentalization event is established during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawrence &#x26; Morata, 1977</xref>) and separates anterior (A) and posterior (P) compartments in each segment. The A/P boundaries in the different body segments not only separate the original lineage blocks of the fly; they also are topological landmarks to delimit Hox genes expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawrence, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Since the initial establishment of the A/P boundary, the P compartments acquire expression of the <italic>engrailed (en)</italic> gene, which determines anterior or posterior identity within each segment: the &#x2018;on&#x2019; state specifies posterior whereas the &#x2018;off&#x2019; state specifies anterior identity. This early lineage segregation is preserved for the rest of the development in all larval and adult structures. In the imaginal discs (the precursors of the adult cuticular structures) <italic>en</italic> remains expressed in the P compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brower, 1986</xref>) and is also required to maintain the A/P border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morata and Lawrence, 1975</xref>). The absence of <italic>en</italic> function in the A compartment allows anterior cells to activate the Hh pathway and subsequently the <italic>cubitus interruptus (ci)</italic> gene, a marker of A compartment identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orenic et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>The expression of <italic>en</italic> is regulated epigenetically. It is kept in <italic>off</italic> (silenced) state in the A compartments through the activity of the Polycomb-G genes (Pc-G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busturia and Morata, 1988</xref>), whereas the trithorax-G genes (trx<italic>-</italic>G) maintain <italic>en</italic> in <italic>on</italic> state in P compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breen et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the A/P boundary, there is in the wing disc another lineage border, separating the dorsal (D) and the ventral (V) compartments. This boundary appears during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>) and is dependent on the activity of the gene <italic>apterous</italic> (<italic>ap</italic>), which confers dorsal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The A/P and the D/V borders not only separate cells with different identities in the wing disc; they also function as developmental organizers of the imaginal discs. The posterior compartment cells secrete the Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen that activates the <italic>decapentaplegic (dpp)</italic> gene in the anterior cells close to the border, from where the Dpp signal diffuses to the two compartments and controls their growth and pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrence and Struhl, 1996</xref>). The Wg signal emanating from the D/V border also has a major patterning function in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irvine and Vogt, 1997</xref>).</p><p>It follows that the establishment and maintenance of the A/P and D/V boundaries are critical factors in the development of the wing disc and that major alterations of these boundaries would grossly interfere with normal pattern and growth. Therefore, it is expected that regenerative processes incorporate mechanisms to ensure the restoration of these borders in damaged discs. The possibility of collapse and subsequent restoration of the A/P border during regeneration in the wing disc was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabad et al. (1979)</xref>, although recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergantinos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>) have failed to observe lineage transgressions after massive damage to the disc.</p><p>We are investigating the regenerative response of imaginal discs to the ablation of specific compartments, and especially how the stability of compartment boundaries is maintained. Our results indicate that ablation of the P or the D compartment causes a transient collapse of the A/P or the D/V boundaries, which are very quickly reconstructed. During the reconstruction process some cells are reprogrammed and change their original compartmental identity. We provide evidence that the identity changes are associated with gain of activity of the JNK pathway and with relaxation of the epigenetic control by the Pc-G and trx-G genes. In addition, we suggest that the identity changes observed are induced by a novel mechanism by which isolated cells acquire the identity of their neighbours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>In the experiments to induce massive damage to specific compartments, equivalent to ablation, we have utilized the Gal4/UAS/Gal80<sup>TS</sup> method (see &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019; for details) to force high levels of apoptosis in specific domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergantinos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herrera et al., 2013</xref>). The temperature-sensitive Gal4 suppressor Gal80 allows temporal manipulation of Gal4 activity. In these experiments a temperature shift from 17 to 29&#xb0;C causes a loss of Gal80 function, which now permits the activity of the Gal4 driver. In turn, Gal4 activates the UAS<italic>-hid</italic> and UAS<italic>-Flp</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The activation of UAS<italic>-hid</italic> with the <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> driver causes massive apoptosis in the P compartment. In addition, the high levels of Flipase generated by the UAS<italic>-flp</italic> transgene induce recombination in the <italic>act&#x3e;stop&#x3e;lacZ</italic> cassette, with the result that the cells of the original P compartment become indelibly marked with the activity of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene, which encodes the &#xdf;Gal protein. Under our experimental conditions (48 hr of continuous Flp activity) all the cells of the P compartment acquire the &#xdf;Gal label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We refer to these cells as the &#x2018;Hh lineage&#x2019;. This is an important point because we consider the &#xdf;Gal label as the indicator of the compartmental provenance of the cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01831.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ablation of the posterior compartment.</title><p>Wing imaginal discs after 48 hr of induction of GFP (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold> and <bold>E</bold>, controls) or <italic>hid</italic> (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold> and <bold>F</bold>).

The idea was that if the A/P border had collapsed during ablation some marked clones induced before or at the time of collapse should include anterior and posterior cells. We generated &#x2018;twin clones&#x2019; such that we labeled the progeny of the two cells resulting from mitotic recombination events (see &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;). The clones were generated at the beginning of the ablation period and fixed the discs at different times after the end. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, we found numerous cases of clones crossing over the A/P border (10 cases of crossing in 16 discs examined). These transgressions do not appear in discs of the same genotype in which the P compartment is not ablated.</p><p>A loss of lineage restriction was also observed in the D/V compartment boundary after ablation of the D compartment. As in the experiment to assay the A/P boundary, we can follow the lineage of the D compartments by labeling the cells with the UAS-Flipase system (see &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that cells of ventral provenance appear integrated in the regenerated D compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Therefore, we have examined whether it plays a role in the lineage transgressions we observe. We had previously noticed that JNK is up regulated in the P compartments of ablated <italic>hh &#x3e; hid</italic> discs, as shown by the activation of the <italic>puc</italic>-LacZ marker, which is not normally expressed in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,B&#x2032;</xref>). This was expected because Hid induces JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shlevkov and Morata, 2012</xref>), but we also find anterior compartment cells near the A/P border that express the <italic>puc</italic>-LacZ marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A&#x2013;A&#x2032;&#x2032;</xref>).</p><p>We designed a special experiment combining the lexA/lexO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>) and the Gal4/UAS binary systems to examine the involvement of JNK in the A/P lineage transgressions. The rationale was to induce massive cell death in the region of the A compartment close to the A/P border, and at the same time to prevent activation of JNK in the P compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, details in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;).

This suggested that the local developmental environment could play a role in determining the acquisition of the new identity.

Clones in the anterior compartment expressing the Gal4-suppressor Gal80 are surrounded by cells with high levels of <italic>en</italic> activity driven by the <italic>act</italic>-Gal4 line.

The Hh-mediated activation would not depend on clone density.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results reported bear on the regenerative response of the wing disc to ablation of the posterior or the dorsal compartment. Compartments are independent lineage blocks and express different genetic/developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawrence, 1992</xref>). Since the majority of our experiments concern the response of the P compartment, we restrict the discussion to those, although we are confident the conclusions also apply to the D compartment.</p><p>We find that the P compartment fully regenerates after a massive damage that kills the majority of the cells. There is a proliferative response aimed to restore the normal size of the compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This response is easily visualized during post-ablation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E&#x2013;H</xref>), although it may start during the ablation: the fact that clones in the P compartment, which is under ablation, grow as much as those in the control A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A&#x2013;D</xref>) suggests that they perform more cell divisions. The autonomous proliferative response of the A and P compartment provides further evidence to the proposal that A and P compartments are units of growth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin and Morata, 2006</xref>).</p><p>One unexpected result is that the ablation of one compartment, be it the P or the D compartment, results in a transient collapse of the A/P or the D/V boundary. Cells of anterior origin can penetrate into the P compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and vice versa, cells of posterior origin can penetrate into the A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The latter result is significant because the A compartment was undamaged and therefore the penetration of cells of posterior provenance cannot be due to a repair mechanism.</p><p>Possibly, the collapse of the boundary results from a transient loss (or debilitation) of the identity of cells in the P compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>) and likely some anterior cells close to the border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). As a consequence posterior cells can mix with juxtaposing anterior cells, in effect eliminating the boundary.</p><p>We believe the behavior of the posterior cells derives from a diminution of <italic>en</italic> activity, responsible for posterior identity and for maintaining the A/P border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morata and Lawrence, 1975</xref>). In turn, it appears to be caused by two factors: attenuation of the control exerted by the Pc-G and trx-G genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and up regulation of the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These two pathways are known to be involved in controlling <italic>en</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busturia and Morata, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gettings et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We observe that the collapse of the boundary is followed by a very rapid reconstruction. The fact that there is a functional A/P border after 48 hr of ablation and without allowing time for recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), strongly suggests an immediate re-establishment. The reconstruction must result from the acquisition of new anterior or posterior identities by the cells close to the border.</p><p>We believe that the mechanism behind this reprogramming is the phenomenon of gene induction by neighbors that we report here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A&#x2013;H&#x2032;</xref>): islands of anterior cells in which <italic>en</italic> is originally inactive are induced to activate the gene when surrounded by <italic>en</italic>-expressing cells. This phenomenon provides an explanation for the changes of identity observed in the proximity of the A/P border of regenerating discs that we outline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I&#x2013;L</xref>. In the developmental context of the wing disc, the cells around the A/P border only have the option of being <italic>en</italic>-<italic>on</italic> or <italic>en</italic>-<italic>off</italic>, depending on the active genotype of surrounding cells.</p><p>This non-autonomous induction may also have general implications about how major genetic/developmental decisions occur during development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> many developmental decisions are taken collectively by small groups of cells: the compartmental subdivisions occur in groups of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>). Similarly, the phenomenon of &#x2018;transdetermination&#x2019; in which cells change their original segmental determination in transplantation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gehring, 1967</xref>), is not a clonal but a collective decision. These examples are cases of group decisions, in which the local context plays a role. These group interactions to generate a coherent pattern of developmental resemble the &#x2018;community effect&#x2019; described by John Gurdon years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gurdon, 1988</xref>).</p><p>One could speculate that induction by neighbors may be part of a group decision process during normal development. The initial activation of <italic>en</italic> during embryogenesis is induced by the transcription factors <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiNardo et al., 1988</xref>). It is possible that not all the cells respond similarly to Eve or Ftz&#x2014;it is known that the initial <italic>en</italic> expression is inhomogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiNardo et al., 1985</xref>). The secondary induction via the local context would ensure the coherent activation of <italic>engrailed</italic> in the entire group. There is a recent report suggesting the possibility that the En protein may act as a short-range signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Layalle et al., 2011</xref>). It raises the possibility that the En product itself may activate <italic>en</italic> non-autonomously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks used were <italic>hh</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>); <italic>ap</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calleja et al., 1996</xref>); ET-40 (named in the text as <italic>Psc</italic>-QF) and QUAS-<italic>mtdTomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Potter et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>dpp</italic>-LHG-86Fb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>); lexO-<italic>hid</italic> (a kind gift of Ainhoa P&#xe9;rez-Garijo and Hermann Steller); <italic>puc</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> line (pucE69) and UAS-<italic>puc</italic>14C line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Blanco et al., 1998</xref>); <italic>act</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic>, UAS-<italic>GFP</italic>, UAS-<italic>hid</italic>7 (named in the text as UAS-<italic>hid</italic>), UAS-<italic>Flp</italic>, UAS-<italic>LacZ</italic>, <italic>tub</italic>-Gal80<sup>TS</sup>, <italic>arm</italic>-<italic>LacZ</italic> FRT80B and <italic>ubi</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> FRT80B (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center); UAS-<italic>en</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guillen et al., 1995</xref>); <italic>hs</italic>-<italic>Flp112</italic> and <italic>act</italic>&#x3e;stop&#x3e;<italic>lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Struhl and Basler, 1993</xref>); <italic>ubiP63E</italic>&#x3e;stop&#x3e;<italic>GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>tubP</italic>&#x3e;stop&#x3e;Gal80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohm et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>mew</italic>-<italic>YFP</italic> (named in the text as PS1&#x3b1;-<italic>YFP</italic>, Kyoto Stock Center CPTI-001678); <italic>Pc</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis, 1978</xref>); <italic>trx</italic><sup><italic>E2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kennison and Tamkun, 1988</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers agree that this paper is potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> but that it does need substantial work to make it acceptable. The overriding issue that needs addressing is to make more solid and convincing the main conclusion of the paper, that there is a breakdown of compartmental boundaries that allows transgression of anterior and posterior cells. The current conclusions are interesting but somewhat superficial in places and there is a clear consensus that additional rigor is needed before it can be accepted. Specific concerns agreed by the three reviewers follow.</p><p>1) Much of the data would be interpreted differently if the b-gal genetic marker is not as precise as claimed. If 100 % of P cells are not &#x03B2;gal marked, then the unlabeled clones in the P compartment might not have crossed from the anterior. To exclude the possibility that the label-negative cells arise not from transgression from the healthy compartment but from a few cells that did not undergo excision of the stop cassette, the authors could mark healthy cells (in this case A cells) with the Lac-Z marker in the following genotype: dpp-LexA LexOp-Flp act&#x3e;&#x3e;LacZ hh-Gal4 tub-gal80ts UAS-hid. Slightly more difficult to explain, but not impossible, is the presence of marked clones in the A compartment: perhaps the dying cells induce occasional ectopic Flp expression in neighboring A cells? The controls support their model, but it is very hard to rule out that the Hid genetic manipulation might affect the normally precise control of Flp activity and/or Gal4 expression under Hh control. The twin clone experiment is harder to explain away, and perhaps is the best evidence for a breakdown of the boundary, but this is not given as much prominence as the main Hh driven &#x03B2;gal approach. The one example shown is at a fold, and may therefore be atypical.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, the number of clones is much too high, preventing rigorous size assessment. Is this figure representative of the pictures used to generate the data tabulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>?</p><p>3) It appears that transgression can occur either from the disrupted to the healthy compartment (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or from the healthy to the disrupted (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If both phenomena are observed, what are their relative frequencies and what are the factors that affect directionality?</p><p>4) Another issue concerns the location along the boundary where transgressions occur. Transgressions are shown at various places along the boundary. An example of disrupted-to-healthy transgression is shown in the middle of the pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The twin clones are shown in the prospective notum and in a few key experiments, transgressions appear to occur preferentially at an epithelial fold. It also appears that JNK upregulation occurs specifically near folds. Transgression at these various locations seem to differ morphologically and it is not clear that they are equivalent. Therefore, it is necessary to define which types of transgression are analyzed in the different genetic backgrounds (at folds or not; towards the disrupted compartment or away from it).</p><p>5) The effect of <italic>Pc</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup><italic>/&#x2b;</italic> on the rate of transgression into the disrupted compartment is impressive. So much so that it needs to be further substantiated (e.g., by labeling the cells of the healthy compartment as suggested above). Moreover, according to the graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), &#x2b;/&#x2b; discs should look like an intermediate between panels A and B. This is not apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors analyze transgression size in a heterozygous background of <italic>Pc</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup><italic>/&#x2b;</italic> or <italic>trx</italic><sup><italic>E2</italic></sup><italic>/&#x2b;.</italic> They claim that the transgression size in the P compartment is altered because of changes in the epigenetic control mechanisms related to reprogramming. However, the hedgehog gene itself is under control of epigenetic regulation (Maurange and Paro, 2002), raising the possibility that the alterations in transgression size might be due to higher or lower activities of hh-GAL4 (and hence expression of hid). This could be tested by monitoring the activity of hh-Gal4 in the different genetic backgrounds using a reporter (e.g., UAS-GFP).</p><p>7) Unlike much of the rest of the data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D-G</xref>, are not very clear. The changes in Psc and H3K4 expression could be shown in a way that makes it easier for the reader to judge the extent of the changes.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors test whether en-expressing cells can induce <italic>en-lacZ</italic> expression in neighboring cells. They show that this is indeed the case for cells in the anterior compartment. In the posterior compartment, where en-lacZ is normally active, however, en-lacZ is apparently repressed in clones of cells expressing Engrailed (panel B&#x27;). This raises concerns about the physiological relevance of the expression level of Engrailed in the clones and thus the validity of the conclusion. The authors could lower expression levels by using an expression system independent of the highly active Gal4/UAS system, by reducing the temperature (the Gal4 system is less active at 18C), or by co-expressing Gal80ts. Furthermore, as the authors acknowledge, engrailed normally becomes active in the A compartment at late stages of discs development. They suggest that this is not true for en-lacZ. They conclude therefore that non-autonomous engrailed expression represents a true fate change (A to P). However, the nature of the <italic>en-lacZ</italic> allele is not specified. This is important because at least one <italic>en-lacz</italic> line (known as <italic>xho25 en-lacZ</italic>) is upregulated in the A compartment (Blair 1992). Therefore the conclusion that engrailed is activated in a non-autonomous manner needs further evidence, perhaps with higher quality anti-En staining and a demonstration that Ptc expression is suppressed in these cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01831.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The overriding issue that needs addressing is to make more solid and convincing the main conclusion of the paper, that there is a breakdown of compartmental boundaries that allows transgression of anterior and posterior cells.

It is obvious from the figure that the transgressions localize in the neighbourhood of the A/P border. This argues very strongly against the incomplete label hypothesis. We discuss this possibility in the revised version and are incorporating the image in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>To exclude the possibility that the label-negative cells arise not from transgression from the healthy compartment but from a few cells that did not undergo excision of the stop cassette, the authors could mark healthy cells (in this case A cells) with the Lac-Z marker in the following genotype: dpp-LexA LexOp-Flp act&#x3e;&#x3e;LacZ hh-Gal4 tub-gal80ts UAS-hid</italic>.</p><p>Although the argument in the preceding paragraph argues very strongly against the possibility put forward by the reviewers, we seriously considered performing the experiment they suggested. The experiment is in principle a good one, but unfortunately it does not work. This is because the dpp-LexA line is not only expressed in the A compartment just anterior to the A/P border, but it is also expressed in the hinge region of the P compartment and in some spots elsewhere. As a consequence we are bound to find posterior cells labelled with lacZ. For the reviewers&#x2019; information we include an image of a wing disc of genotype dpp-LexA&#x3e;LexO-GFP that shows GFP label in the P compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife01831f007"/></fig></p><p>Nevertheless, you should note that in the paper we report an experiment that is a way similar to that suggested by the reviewers; in dpp-LexA/lexO-hid hh-Gal4 UAS-Flp ubi&#x3e;&#x3e;GFP we kill anterior cells and label healthy posterior cells marked with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-E&#x201d;</xref>). We find that posterior cells penetrate into the A compartment and express the GFP marker. In this case the expression of the dpp-LexA line in the proximal region of the P compartment should not have an effect on the results.</p><p><italic>Slightly more difficult to explain, but not impossible, is the presence of marked clones in the A compartment: perhaps the dying cells induce occasional ectopic Flp expression in neighboring A cells? The controls support their model, but it is very hard to rule out that the Hid genetic manipulation might affect the normally precise control of Flp activity and/or Gal4 expression under Hh control</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers suggest the possibility that the label of anterior cells with the posterior marker lacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) is not due to penetration of P cells into the A compartment, but to a transient hh expression in A cells (induced by dying posterior cells) that drives Flp and presumably also transforms them into P identity. But then these newly transformed P cells would have to change again to re-acquire anterior identity. The induction of successive changes of identity seems to us to be very unlikely.</p><p><italic>The twin clone experiment is harder to explain away, and perhaps is the best evidence for a breakdown of the boundary, but this is not given as much prominence as the main Hh driven &#x03B2;gal approach. The one example shown is at a fold, and may therefore be atypical</italic>.</p><p>In the revised version we have modified the text to give more emphasis to these results. We selected the disc for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> because it makes a very good case for transgression. It is not frequent to have two pairs of twin clones in the same disc, both crossing the A/P border. Only one pair is close to a fold but not the other. For the reviewers&#x2019; information we are including some additional images showing other clones that are not associated with folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife01831f008"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref><italic>, the number of clones is much too high, preventing rigorous size assessment.

If both phenomena are observed, what are</italic> <italic>their relative frequencies and what are the factors that affect directionality</italic>?</p><p>We now include the number of cases of A to P and of P to A transgressions. The latter is clearly smaller, likely due to the fact that the number of P cells is smaller after the Hid treatment.</p><p>Concerning the factors responsible for the directionality, we discuss this issue in the Discussion section. Our argument is that there is a collapse of the A/P border due to a transient slackening of the epigenetic control exerted by the <italic>Pc-G</italic> and <italic>trx-G</italic> genes. As a result many cells of either anterior or posterior origin descend to a &#x201c;na&#xef;ve&#x201d; identity and can mix. Due to the reprogramming during the reconstruction of the border, some cells acquire an identity different from the original one. The result is that we can observe transgressions from A to P and conversely from P to A.</p><p><italic>4) Another issue concerns the location along the boundary where transgressions occur.

Curiously, the P to A transgressions show a different positional pattern. We observe upregulation of JNK in anterior cells anywhere along the A/P border &#x2013; no indication of preference for folds.</p><p><italic>5) The effect of Pc</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup><italic>/&#x2b; on the rate of transgression into the disrupted compartment is impressive.

We present the alterations of Psc and H3K4 levels after Hid treatment in three different discs in each case.

But, in our control experiments we never find <italic>en</italic> expression in the A compartment.

The evidence for anterior <italic>en</italic> expression in <italic>ryxho25 en-lacZ</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> where one can see some local lacZ staining anterior to the A/P line. We suspect it might be an artefact generated by the staining in the peripodial membrane.</p><p>Also, as we argue in the paper, the non-autonomous induction of <italic>engrailed</italic> appears only when the <italic>en</italic>-expressing clones cover most of the A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-E&#x201d;</xref>). When there are fewer clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B&#x201d;</xref>) <italic>engrailed</italic> is not induced. This would not be expected if the non-autonomous <italic>en</italic> activity were due to the Hh-dependant induction in late development reported by Blair.</p><p>In addition, we have tried to satisfy the reviewers with better anti-En staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6&#x2013;figure supplement 1 A-B&#x201d;</xref>) and by showing that Ptc is down regulated in anterior cells gaining <italic>engrailed</italic> non-autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6&#x2013;figure supplement 1 C-D&#x201d;</xref>).
