fertilization. In mouse sperm, the principal K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current (I<sub>KSper</sub>) is carried by the Slo3 channel, which sets the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) in a strongly pH<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner. Here, we show that I<sub>KSper</sub> in human sperm is activated weakly by pH<sub>i</sub> and more strongly by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. Correspondingly, V<sub>m</sub> is strongly regulated by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> and less so by pH<sub>i</sub>. We find that inhibitors of Slo3 suppress human I<sub>KSper</sub>, and we identify the Slo3 protein in the flagellum of human sperm. Moreover, heterologously expressed human Slo3, but not mouse Slo3, is activated by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> rather than by alkaline pH<sub>i</sub>; current&#x2013;voltage relations of human Slo3 and human I<sub>KSper</sub> are similar. We conclude that Slo3 represents the principal K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channel in human sperm that carries the Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-activated I<sub>KSper</sub> current. We propose that, in human sperm, the progesterone-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> influx carried by voltage-gated CatSper channels is limited by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-controlled hyperpolarization via Slo3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01438.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01438.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01438.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A sperm that has been ejaculated into the female reproductive tract must complete a number of tasks to pass on its genes to the next generation. First it must travel along a meandering route to encounter an egg, before pushing through a jelly-like coating that surrounds the egg and then, finally, fusing with the egg&#x2019;s surface membrane. In order to complete these steps and fertilise the egg, a sperm must undergo a process called &#x2018;capacitation&#x2019;. This process, and a variety of other sperm functions, involves the controlled flux of positive ions into and out of the sperm via specific ion channels that are located in the cell membrane.</p><p>The properties of the ion channels that allow protons and calcium ions to move into and out of human sperm are well understood, but less is known about the channels that control the movement of potassium ions. In mice, a channel called Slo3 allows potassium ions to flow out of the sperm and makes the membrane voltage of these cells more negative. Also, in mice, this channel is essential for the sperm to function correctly, and for fertilization. However, in humans, it is unclear if the Slo3 channel is present in sperm and if it performs the same role.</p><p>Now, Brenker et al. have shown that the flow of potassium ions out of human sperm occurs via the Slo3 channel, and that human Slo3 is responsible for setting the membrane voltage of these cells. However, whereas the mouse Slo3 channel is opened in response to a decrease in the concentration of protons within the sperm (i.e., an increase of the pH inside the cell), human Slo3 is largely controlled by changes in the levels of calcium ions. An increase in the calcium concentration within the cell opens the human Slo3 channel, more than a decrease in the proton concentration does.</p><p>Altogether, Brenker et al. identify Slo3 as the principal potassium channel in human sperm and reveal more fundamental differences between human sperm and mouse sperm. Thereby, this work further stresses the need to be cautious about using mice as a model of male fertility in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01438.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01438.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>human sperm</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>Slo3</kwd><kwd>Ca2&#x2b;-activated K&#x2b; channel</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp recordings</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>German Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>SFB645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#xfc;ller</surname><given-names>Astrid</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaupp</surname><given-names>U Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Str&#xfc;nker</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef identification ID: </ext-link> <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>GM066215; GM081748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lingle</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>0.7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The principal potassium ion channel in human sperm, Slo3, is primarily activated by calcium ions and controls the membrane potential of human sperm by intracellular calcium ion levels rather than intracellular pH.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian sperm fulfil several demanding functions during fertilization: sperm track down the oocyte presumably by chemotaxis, rheotaxis, or thermotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaupp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>). Moreover, sperm break through the oocyte&#x2019;s vestments by hyperactivation and acrosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Florman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho and Suarez, 2001</xref>). Sperm acquire these skills inside the female genital tract during a maturation process called capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraser, 2010</xref>). Navigation, capacitation, hyperactivation, and acrosomal exocytosis are controlled by changes in intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>), membrane voltage (V<sub>m</sub>), and intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho and Suarez, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Florman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaupp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Publicover et al., 2008</xref>). These cellular responses are orchestrated by a set of unique ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darszon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lishko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Santi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A picture has emerged that the inventory and control of ion channels in mouse and human sperm are surprisingly different. For example, human but not mouse sperm harbor functional proton Hv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lishko et al., 2010</xref>); purinergic P2X channels are functional in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>), but not in human sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>); the sperm-specific CatSper (cation channel of sperm) Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> channel is activated by progesterone in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Str&#xfc;nker et al., 2011</xref>), but not in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>). These different channel inventories and different mechanisms of channel activation might reflect adaptations to species-specific challenges encountered by sperm in the female genital tract.</p><p>In mouse sperm, an alkaline-activated K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current, called I<sub>KSper</sub>, is a critical determinant of V<sub>m</sub> and, thereby, controls other V<sub>m</sub>-dependent channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro et al., 2007</xref>). Mouse I<sub>KSper</sub> is carried by the sperm-specific Slo3 channel. Deletion of the Slo3 gene abolishes I<sub>KSper</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2013</xref>); male <italic>Slo3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice are infertile due to defects in sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>), osmoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>), and acrosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In humans, it is unknown whether Slo3 is functionally expressed in sperm and serves a similar key role for fertilization. Here, we examine the properties of human sperm K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current by patch-clamp recording and also define properties of currents arising from heterologous expression of hSlo3 and its auxiliary subunit hLRRC52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). We find that human I<sub>KSper</sub> and heterologously expressed human Slo3 currents share similar biophysical properties, pharmacology, and ligand dependence. Furthermore, we identify Slo3 and LRRC52 proteins in human sperm. Remarkably, whereas mouse Slo3 is exclusively controlled by pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schreiber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>), activation of human Slo3 is regulated by [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and also, more weakly, by cytosolic alkalization. These results show that, between mouse and human sperm, signalling pathways controlling the principal K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channel and, thereby, V<sub>m</sub> are also distinctively different.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of I<sub>Ksper</sub> in human sperm</title><p>We recorded currents from human sperm by the patch-clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lishko et al., 2013</xref>).

This difference might be due to the non-mammalian expression system, the excised-patch conditions, differences in ionic composition of solutions, or a combination of all of them. Therefore, we recorded whole-cell currents evoked by voltage steps in CHO cells that co-expressed hSlo3 and hLRRC52, using conditions similar to those used for sperm recordings. hSlo3 currents in CHO cells were also modestly enhanced by alkalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>), and Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> shifted the I-V relation to more negative V<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>).

At pH<sub>i</sub> 8, Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> (60 or 300 &#xb5;M) did not enhance currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

(2013)</xref> reported that the prototypical Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-activated member of the Slo channel family, Slo1, is the principal K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channel in human sperm. Several observations strongly argue against this conclusion. First, Slo1 is inhibited rather than activated at alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avdonin et al., 2003</xref>). Second, specific inhibitors of Slo1 did not inhibit I<sub>KSper</sub>. Third, human Slo1 is largely insensitive to progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). Fourth, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) are unable to identify the Slo1 protein in human sperm. Fifth, if Slo1 carried the current of about 125&#x2013;150 pA in human sperm (recorded at 100 mV in symmetrical K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> and saturating Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>), this would correspond to the opening of about 5&#x2013;6 BK channels. Under such conditions, discrete opening and closing transitions of single BK channels would be readily visible; not only at 100 mV, but even more so at voltages &#x3c; 100 mV. Thus, recordings of I<sub>KSper</sub> current in human sperm are consistent with lower conductance openings characteristic of Slo3, but not Slo1. Finally, the most obvious discrepancy between the two reports concerns the pharmacology. Mannowetz et al. show that K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> currents in human sperm are abolished by the Slo1 inhibitors IBTX, charybdotoxin (CTX), and paxilline. Although we do not know the reason for this discrepancy, there are differences in experimental conditions. We tested the inhibitors at 1 mM extracellular [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] to prevent monovalent CatSper currents and at 1 mM intracellular [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] to strongly activate I<sub>KSper</sub>. Mannowetz et al. tested the drugs at 100 &#xb5;M extracellular [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] and in the absence of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. Under these conditions, sizeable CatSper currents are recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), but activation of Slo1 would be minimal.</p><p>What might be the function of Slo3 in sperm? It has been suggested that the I<sub>KSper</sub>-mediated hyperpolarization reinforces Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> influx via CatSper by increasing the electrical driving force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapham, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, we propose that the hyperpolarization serves as a negative feedback that decreases the open probability of CatSper and, thereby, curtails rather than enhances Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> influx. Why did Slo3 switch in human sperm from a strictly pH-sensitive to a pH- and Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-sensitive K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channel? In mouse, Slo3 and CatSper are both voltage- and strongly alkaline-activated. In human but not in mouse sperm, CatSper is directly activated by progesterone and prostaglandins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Str&#xfc;nker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, human CatSper mediates a ligand- rather than an alkaline-activated Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> influx. Moreover, the pH sensitivity of both Slo3 and CatSper is considerably lower in human compared to mouse sperm, suggesting that Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> activation of Slo3 may have evolved in concert with ligand activation of CatSper. This co-evolution might ensure that ligand-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> influx via CatSper is coupled to the Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-controlled hyperpolarization via Slo3. Thus, by curtailing Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> influx via CatSper, I<sub>Ksper</sub> may serve a similar role in both mouse and human sperm despite its differential regulation by intracellular ligands. The control of V<sub>m</sub> by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> and pH<sub>i</sub> and the interplay of CatSper and Slo3 deserve further study in intact, freely moving human sperm with non-invasive and kinetic techniques, for example using voltage-sensitive dyes.</p><p>Our results suggest that during a progesterone response, global Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> levels can reach concentrations &#x3e; 10 &#xb5;M, sufficient to activate Slo3. CatSper and Slo3 are both located in the principal piece. Moreover, progesterone-induced Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> signals originate in the flagellum and propagate in a tail-to-head direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Servin-Vences et al., 2012</xref>). Due to the miniscule flagellar volume (about 2.5 fl), opening a few CatSper channels, each conducting several thousand Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> ions per second, would increase local flagellar [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] to levels that should readily exceed global [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The potential interplay of Slo3 and CatSper in sperm is reminiscent of the interplay in neurons between Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channels and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prakriya and Lingle, 2000</xref>). In neurons, Slo1 and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels interact to form local microdomains of Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> signalling near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkefeld et al., 2006</xref>). In microdomains, [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] can rise to levels &#x227f; 100 &#xb5;M that are readily sensed by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizzuto and Pozzan, 2006</xref>). It needs to be shown whether Slo3 and CatSper are organized in similar microdomains.</p><p>Channels of the Slo family have been studied as models for allosteric regulation of gating by ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magleby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lingle, 2007</xref>). Slo channels and a large number of bacterial channels/transporters harbor a homologous octameric intracellular domain, dubbed the gating ring, that provides a template for ligand regulation of the pore domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lingle, 2007</xref>). The gating-ring motif has evolved for regulation of transmembrane ion flux by nucleotides, Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, H<sup>&#x2b;</sup>, Na<sup>&#x2b;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and probably other cytosolic ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salkoff et al., 2006</xref>). Among different Slo isoforms, gating rings share structural similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leonetti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). However, the conformational changes that couple binding to gating remain incompletely defined and the location of ligand-binding sites varies markedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salkoff et al., 2006</xref>). Our study adds an interesting twist, demonstrating that, even among Slo3 orthologues, the gating-ring motif has been exploited for regulation by different ligands &#x2014; primarily Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> in hSlo3 and primarily H<sup>&#x2b;</sup> in mSlo3. Alignment of human Slo1 sequence with human Slo3 and other mammalian Slo3 sequences illustrates that, although the membrane-associated S0-S6 domain retains considerable identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>), there is extensive lack of identity in many segments of the ligand-sensing cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9&#x2014;figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that positions of ligand-sensing determinants in regulator of K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> conductance (RCK)-containing proteins vary markedly within the RCK domain structures, it is not surprising that simple examination of the Slo3 sequence alignments does not reveal obvious determinants of either pH sensitivity in mSlo3 or Ca<sup>2&#x2b;&#x2212;</sup>sensitivity in hSlo3.</p><p>At first glance, the fact that Slo3 orthologues differ in their ligand-dependence seems highly unusual. Yet, it is well-established that proteins essential for fertilization are rapidly evolving; orthologues often display a low degree of sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swanson and Vacquier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Clapham, 2008</xref>). For a set of mammalian species (human, bovine, mouse, dog, and opossum), the amino-acid identities (excluding a non-specific linker in the cytosolic domain) among Slo1 orthologues is typically &#x3e; 92.6% (mSlo1 vs hSlo1: 99.5%). Slo3 orthologues exhibit identities in the range of 57&#x2013;75% (mSlo3 vs hSlo3: 70.4%). Considering that the amino-acid identity between the pH-regulated mSlo3 and Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-regulated mSlo1 is 45.7%, the different ligand dependence between hSlo3 and mSlo3 is not so surprising.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>IBTX was purchased from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Sperm were loaded with the respective fluorescent Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> indicator (10 &#x3bc;M) (Molecular Probes) in the presence of Pluronic F127 (0.1% wt/vol) for 45 min at 37&#xb0;C. After incubation, excess dye was removed by a centrifugation step (700&#xd7;<italic>g</italic>, 10 min, RT). The sperm pellet was resuspended in HTF<sup>&#x2b;&#x2b;</sup> and equilibrated for 5 min at 37&#xb0;C. Each well was filled with 50 &#xb5;l of the sperm suspension (1 &#xd7; 10<sup>7</sup> sperm/ml); the fluorescence was excited at 480 nm and emission was recorded at 520 nm with bottom optics. Fluorescence was recorded before and after injection of 10 &#xb5;l (1:6 dilution) of progesterone or ionomycin in HTF<sup>&#x2b;&#x2b;</sup>. The solutions were injected into the wells manually with an electronic multichannel pipette.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis and fitting of the data were performed using OriginPro 8.1 G SR3 (OriginLab Corporation, USA) or Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices).

We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication.</p><p>As can be seen from the enclosed reviews, there are substantial concerns about the data and conclusions, primarily concerning the sperm patch clamp data. The heterologous expression data showing calcium activation of hSlo3 are, on the other hand, convincing and quite interesting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The authors present compelling evidence that that Ksper current in human sperm is carried by the Slo3 potassium channel, as in mouse sperm, but the channel is gated by calcium, unlike in mouse where it is gated by protons. Heterologous expression studies confirm that human Slo3 seems to be calcium gated.</p><p>The results suggest that the Slo3 channel is gated by different ligands in different species. It is puzzling that the authors agree with the results of the Lishko lab that human Ksper is activated by calcium, but disagree as to which channel it is, as the Lishko paper argues that the mouse Ksper is in fact the (normally calcium gated) Slo1. I find no reason to doubt either study&#x27;s conclusions and I expect the controversy to be settled with future work.</p><p>I believe the paper to be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, especially as the Lishko paper appeared there also.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>In the present manuscript, Struenker and colleagues describe functional differences between mouse and human Slo3 K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channels expressed in spermatozoa. The authors provide experimental evidence for Slo3 expression in human spermatozoa and emphasize relevant functional differences: In contrast to mouse, hSlo3 is more sensitive to calcium than to intracellular alkalinisation. Functional hallmarks of hSlo3 as seen in sperm can be recapitulated in CHO cells expressing recombinant hSlo3 and the auxiliary subunit LRRC52. The authors put forward the proposal that during evolution the increased calcium sensitivity of hSlo2 has evolved in concert with the ligand sensitivity of human CatSper.</p><p>In principle, this is a carefully performed study that contributes to our understanding to the regulation of ion fluxes in human sperm. The major tenet of this manuscript, i.e., distinct and relevant species differences between human and mouse sperm, is about to impact the use of mouse sperm as a model system for humans.</p><p>However, mechanistically and conceptually the advances of the current manuscript are limited. The salient role of Slo3 in mouse sperm has recently been highlighted by several groups. It is well documented in the literature that mouse Slo3 is rather insensitive to calcium and that human Slo3 coexpressed with LRRC52 is less sensitive to alkaline pH as compared to mouse. The authors confirm these observation by others by direct electrophysiological recordings in human sperm. However, no information is provided on the molecular basis underlying these functional differences. Thus, the present manuscript still leaves central mechanistic questions unanswered and the paper is confirmatory to quite some extent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>There are three major conclusions in this paper. First, the human K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current I<sub>Ksper</sub> is activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, rather than pH increase as previously established in mice. Second, Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> increase in human sperm under &#x201c;physiological&#x201d; conditions (presumably through Catsper) is sufficient to activate I<sub>Ksper</sub>. Third, heterologously expressed human Slo3 (hSlo3) is activated by high [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but is less sensitive to pH. These findings, if confirmed, represent a major step forward in our understanding of sperm membrane potential regulation and fertilization. The third conclusion is very well supported by careful and well-controlled analysis using heterologous expression in both Xenopus oocytes and CHO cells, with or without the auxiliary subunit LRRC52. I find that the first two conclusions, though quite interesting, are not convincing at their present form.</p><p>The major data supporting the conclusion that human I<sub>Ksper</sub> is potentiated by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> but not pH<sub>i</sub> is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 &#x26; 3</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> where the authors want to show what Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, not pH, controls V<sub>m</sub> in human sperm, two [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> conditions are compared: 0 Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> and 1 mM Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. The 0 Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> pipette had 1 mM EGTA with no added Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, which results a free [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] of perhaps &#x3c; 10 nM. The pipette solution contains no ATP or GTP. Such condition may be fine for studying the biophysical properties of a channel with voltage-clamping, but is too &#x201c;unphysiological&#x201d; for studying the regulation of membrane potential. It is hard to interpret the apparent lack of large effect on V<sub>m</sub> by pH<sub>i</sub> change under this condition. The authors also cited the paper by Navarro (PNAS 104:7688-7692) to compare the difference between human and mouse sperm in the effects of pH<sub>i</sub> on V<sub>m</sub>. However, there is large difference between the pipette solutions used in the two studies (Navarro et al. included ATP and GTP in the pipette and had apparently different free Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> concentration). The authors should at least test several Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> concentrations close to the physiological levels. In addition, all the pipette solutions have 50 mM HEPES. It&#x27;s not clear whether 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in the bath is able to significantly increase pH<sub>i</sub> when 50 mM HEPES is included in the pipette, and this is critical to the conclusion that pH<sub>i</sub> increase doesn&#x27;t have much effect on V<sub>m</sub>. Finally, the numbers of cells (n &#x3d; 3, 4) are too small to draw statistically significant conclusions, especially when measuring V<sub>m</sub> of primary cells.</p><p>The native I<sub>Ksper</sub>&#x27;s Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> sensitivity is not that strong, at least not until [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> reaches 100 &#x03BC;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors conclude that physiologically stimulated [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] increases can reach the levels sufficient to activate I<sub>Ksper</sub>. The Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> with high concentration of progesterone (2 &#x03BC;M) do not have calibration (though with indicators of various Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> affinity) and, more importantly, are from whole sperm. The majority of the signal is likely from sperm head where Slo3 is not localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Therefore, it&#x27;s hard to make meaningful correlation between the Progesterone-induced Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> increase and <sub>IKsper</sub> activation.</p><p>[Editors&#x27; note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Brenker et al. report that the principal human K channel, like that in mouse, is encoded by Slo3. This contrasts with the recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper by Mannowetz et al. that reported that Slo1 was responsible for human KSper. Although the only definitive proof will be to identify a human male with a Slo3 mutation that affects his sperm motility (just as Lishko did for CatSper), the current Brenker data are convincing that human KSper is most likely Slo3.</p><p>Unlike mouse KSper, the principal K channel in human sperm is primarily activated by internal Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, but only modestly by alkaline pH. This agrees with Mannowetz et al. The primary disparity between the papers is that Mannowetz et al found that the specific Slo1 blocker, Iberiotoxin, blocked human KSper, while Brenker et al find that it does not. The experimental solutions used in the two studies may underlie this difference.</p><p>There are many more data in the current paper characterizing human KSper and this will be of interest to the field. The work is well done and we find no fault with the data. The most interesting new data is that human Slo3 differs from mouse through the Slo3 pore-containing subunit, rather than through association with an LRRC52 accessory subunit.</p><p>The work presents another interesting example that shows that species-specific regulation might have evolved on this essential ion channel protein in sperm, analogous to the different activation mechanisms previously shown in mouse and human CatSper.</p><p>The following issues need to be addressed in the revision: 1) The authors presume that the rapid evolution of gamete genes results in gating ring mutations that confer these changes to human Slo3. It would be of interest to readers to show alignment of mouse, intervening species, and humans to narrow in on the changes most likely to mediate these properties. We do not suggest that the authors sort out the changes by mutagenesis, as this would be a separate work in itself and may take several years to complete.</p><p>2) The mass spec identification supporting the conclusion is not shown. To support the findings, indicators of merit (such as number of peptides and protein coverage etc.) for all the proteins identified and mentioned in the text should be provided as a Table in Supplementary Information.</p><p>3) Although we understand the reasons for using 1 mM Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> in some internal solutions to maximize the response, many readers will question the validity of this condition, and it will likely be a source of contention. This should be at least addressed fully in the discussion. Better would be to show data at intervening 10, 30, 100 &#xb5;M Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. However, the reviewers are not worried by the use of 1 mM Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. The inclusion of data with other concentrations is optional.</p><p>4) Introduction: Navarro et al definitively identified P2X2 channels, not P2X1, in mouse sperm through KO studies. The Brenker study does not identify the P2X channel subtype. After writing a whole paper on the mis-identification of KSper, it is not reassuring that you misidentify P2X in your own summary!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01438.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors&#x2019; note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>While our manuscript was under review, a competing manuscript by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mannowetz et al.

Although we do not know the reason for this discrepancy, there are differences in experimental conditions, which we mention in the Discussion of our revised manuscript. Moreover, to ascertain that human Slo3 is insensitive to Slo1 inhibitors, we studied the action of IBTX, CTX, and paxilline on heterologous hSlo3 &#x2b; LRRC52 channels, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref> below). We find that human Slo3 is insensitive to IBTX, CTX, and paxilline.

We further show that Slo1 is largely insensitive to progesterone. Moreover, we show single-channel recordings from human sperm that reveal a Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> channel of &#x223c; 60-70 pS conductance, i.e., similar to the conductance of human Slo3, but inconsistent with a Slo1 conductance of &#x223c; 240 pS.

If that were the case, we would certainly agree that the manuscript contributes little new information. However, the focus of the manuscript is in establishing that the human sperm K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current is, in fact, regulated by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, with weaker regulation by pH. The prototypical Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>-activated and pH-activated members of this channel family are Slo1 and Slo3, respectively. Thus, the important question is whether the human sperm K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current is carried by Slo1 or Slo3. Our results demonstrate that human I<sub>KSper</sub> current arises from Slo3 and not Slo1. Furthermore, we show that heterologously expressed human Slo3 is Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> regulated. These observations are entirely new and it is surprising that two orthologous proteins, mSlo3 and hSlo3, have such different regulation by cytosolic ligands.</p><p>Identification of the site on the hSlo3 gating ring underlying regulation by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> and H<sup>&#x2b;</sup> is highly interesting, but is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we acknowledge that the extensive introductory paragraph on Slo gating rings in our original manuscript might have led the referee astray. Therefore, we shortened this paragraph and moved it to the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>This referee raised several concerns about the reliability of our electrical recordings from human sperm, in particular, the activation of I<sub>KSper</sub> by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> and pH<sub>i</sub>.

To make comparison of current-clamp and voltage-clamp experiments meaningful, we used the same intracellular solution (without ATP/GTP) throughout the manuscript. Of note, Mannowetz et al. used a similar intracellular solution (also without ATP/GTP) to study human I<sub>KSper</sub>. Under these conditions, our current clamp and voltage-clamp data are consistent, e.g., we observe modest pH<sub>i</sub> control, but stronger Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> control of <sub>IKSper</sub> and V<sub>m</sub>. Current-clamp experiments are always to a certain degree nonphysiological, no matter whether intracellular ATP/GTP is present or not: the cell&#x2019;s cytoplasm is exchanged by artificial intracellular solutions and, moreover, experiments are hampered by the high input resistance of sperm (discussed in Zheng et al. 2013, JGP). Therefore, we have tempered our assertions that Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> rather than pH<sub>i</sub> controls V<sub>m</sub> of human sperm to our recording conditions. Moreover, we now include a paragraph in the discussion stating that it will be an interesting question for future work to determine the relative contributions of cytosolic pH and [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] to the regulation of human sperm function.</p><p>In the current-clamp experiments, we used a pipette [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] of either a few nanomolar or 1 mM to study the action of Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. As requested, we now include current clamp data at 1, 30, and 70 &#x03BC;M Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>, showing that the effect of 1 &#x03BC;M Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> is miniscule, whereas 30 &#x03BC;M evokes a sizeable hyperpolarization that saturates at &#x2264; 70 &#x03BC;M. Thus, the concentration dependence of Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> action is similar in current- and voltage-clamp experiments.</p><p><italic>In addition, all the pipette solutions have 50 mM HEPES. It&#x27;s not clear whether 10 mM NH</italic><sub><italic>4</italic></sub><italic>Cl in the bath is able to significantly increase pH</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>when 50 mM HEPES is included in the pipette, and this is critical to the conclusion that pH</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>increase doesn&#x27;t have much effect on V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>.</p><p>In fact, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl increases pH<sub>i</sub> by about 1 unit under the conditions used (see response to Reviewer 2). The modest action of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl on I<sub>KSper</sub> and V<sub>m</sub> is consistent with the modest changes of I<sub>KSper</sub> and V<sub>m</sub> observed when the pipette pH was changed from pH 6.2 to 7.3. Moreover, at 50 mM intracellular HEPES, we routinely observe NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-induced CatSper activation (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Str&#xfc;nker et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenker et. al. 2012</xref>). Altogether, these results show unequivocally that the modest action of pH<sub>i</sub> on I<sub>KSper</sub> and V<sub>m</sub> is not due to the specifics of our experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>Finally, the numbers of cells (n &#x3d; 3,4) are too small to draw statistically significant conclusions, especially when measuring V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> <italic>of primary cells</italic>.</p><p>We take issue with this comment. First, the small s.d. shows that the V<sub>m</sub> values are highly reproducible. Second, the current-clamp and voltage-clamp results are consistent with each other in all aspects. Third, we tackled each issue by at least 2 different experimental approaches, e.g., we study Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> activation of I<sub>KSper</sub> by both photorelease of Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> and at different Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> concentrations in the pipette; we examine pH<sub>i</sub> activation of I<sub>KSper</sub> by both superfusion with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and by different pipette pH; we study the pharmacology of Slo3 and Slo1 inhibitors in voltage- and current clamp; we study Slo3 currents both in oocytes and CHO cells. These different approaches all lead to the same conclusions. Finally, we note that for most experiments n&#x2265;4.</p><p><italic>The native I</italic><sub><italic>Ksper</italic></sub><italic>&#x27;s Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup> <italic>sensitivity is not that strong, at least not until [Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup><italic>]</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>reaches 100 &#x03BC;M (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3I</italic></xref><italic>). Based on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, the authors conclude that physiologically stimulated [Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup><italic>] increases can reach the levels sufficient to activate I</italic><sub><italic>Ksper</italic></sub><italic>. The Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup> <italic>measurements in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>with high concentration of progesterone (2 &#x03BC;M) do not have calibration (though with indicators of various Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup> <italic>affinity) and, more importantly, are from whole sperm. The majority of the signal is likely from sperm head where Slo3 is not localized (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1H</italic></xref><italic>). Therefore, it&#x27;s hard to make meaningful correlation between the Progesterone-induced Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup> <italic>increase and I</italic><sub><italic>Ksper</italic></sub> <italic>activation.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (now also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, heterologous expression of Slo3) show that [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] (not 100 &#x03BC;M as this referee states) enhances both I<sub>KSper</sub> and hSlo3 currents. We agree with the referee on potential limitations of the Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> indicator experiments in terms of defining absolute concentrations. However, although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) does not show calibrated changes in [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, it clearly argues (in particular the responses recorded with the low-affinity indicator Fluo-5N, K<sub>d</sub> &#x3d; 90 &#x03BC;M) that [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases globally &#x03BC;M. In fact, it has been shown that progesterone-induced Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> signals originate in the flagellum and propagate in a tail-to-head direction (Servin-Vences et al., 2013, Reproduction). Therefore, the local [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] in the flagellum is predicted to be even higher than in the head. However, we state now in the text that the interplay between CatSper and Slo3 requires further experimentation.</p><p>[Editors&#x27; note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Unlike mouse KSper, the principal K channel in human sperm is primarily activated by internal Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup><italic>, but only modestly by alkaline pH. This agrees with Mannowetz et al</italic>.</p><p>We trust that the reviewer means that both studies show that human sperm K<sup>&#x2b;</sup> current is activated by Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>. The two papers reach different conclusions regarding the role of alkaline pH. Mannowetz et al. claim that human I<sub>KSper</sub> is completely insensitive to pH<sub>i</sub>, whereas we and a recent paper by Mansell et al. (Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2014) find that human I<sub>KSper</sub> is enhanced by alkalization.</p><p><italic>The primary disparity between the papers is that Mannowetz et al found that the specific Slo1 blocker, Iberiotoxin, blocked human KSper, while Brenker et al find that it does not. The experimental solutions used in the two studies may underlie this difference</italic>.</p><p>Although the pharmacological differences between the two studies remain difficult to explain, we note that the intracellular and extracellular [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>] used in the pharmacological experiments differ. Overall, our pharmacological profile is consistent with the biochemical evidence for Slo3, the single-channel fingerprint, and the progesterone sensitivity of human I<sub>KSper</sub>.</p><p><italic>The following issues need to be addressed in the revision</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors presume that the rapid evolution of gamete genes results in gating ring mutations that confer these changes to human Slo3. It would be of interest to readers to show alignment of mouse, intervening species, and humans to narrow in on the changes most likely to mediate these properties. We do not suggest that the authors sort out the changes by mutagenesis, as this would be a separate work in itself and may take several years to complete</italic>.</p><p>We include the requested alignment. Unfortunately, the alignment does not provide insights regarding the molecular determinants underlying the different ligand sensitivities of human versus mouse Slo3. Except for the Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> bowl residues, the determinants of the RCK1 high- affinity site and the lower-affinity site involve multiple residues scattered throughout RCK1. For lower-affinity sites, recognition of any &#x201c;site&#x201d; by sequence gazing would be remarkable.</p><p><italic>2) The mass spec identification supporting the conclusion is not shown. To support the findings, indicators of merit (such as number of peptides and protein coverage etc.) for all the proteins identified and mentioned in the text should be provided as a Table in Supplementary Information</italic>.</p><p>We now include a Supplementary file with all indicators of merit for the mass spectrometric results</p><p><italic>3) Although we understand the reasons for using 1 mM Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup> <italic>in some internal solutions to maximize the response, many readers will question the validity of this condition, and it will likely be a source of contention. This should be at least addressed fully in the discussion. Better would be to show data at intervening 10, 30, 100 &#xb5;M Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup><italic>. However, the reviewers are not worried by the use of 1 mM Ca</italic><sup><italic>2&#x2b;</italic></sup><italic>. The inclusion of data with other concentrations is optional</italic>.</p><p>Please note that, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we do, in fact, show current clamp data for 1, 30, 70, and 1,000 &#xb5;M [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement C</xref>, we show I-V curves for I<sub>KSper</sub> at 2.5, 10, 40, 100, and 1,000 &#xb5;M [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Moreover, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we show original current traces at 0, 40, and 1,000 &#xb5;M [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. We feel this data should address the concerns of the reviewer.</p><p>There are three experiments where only 1 mM [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was used:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1) to study the pharmacology of I<sub>KSper</sub>,</p></list-item><list-item><p>2) to show that at high [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, V<sub>m</sub> is independent of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>o</sub>,</p></list-item><list-item><p>3) to show that at high [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, I<sub>KSper</sub> is still potentiated by alkalization.</p></list-item></list><p>For experiment 1, we provide the rationale for using 1 mM [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the results section and in the discussion. For experiments 2 and 3, it is also advisable if not required to use high [Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Accordingly, we do not expect the high concentrations a potential source of contention. Therefore, we prefer to leave the Discussion as it is.</p><p><italic>4) Introduction: Navarro et al definitively identified P2X2 channels, not P2X1, in mouse sperm through KO studies. The Brenker study does not identify the P2X channel subtype. After writing a whole paper on the mis-identification of KSper, it is not reassuring that you misidentify P2X in your own summary</italic>!</p><p>Although we assume that the reviewer made this comment in jest, our work was not about mis-identification of KSper, but simply reports our experiments showing that human KSper is regulated by both cytosolic calcium and alkalization, and that properties of heterologously expressed hSlo3 are consistent with human KSper. Moreover, we thank the referee pointing out the typo regarding P2X channels; we have made some clarifying changes to the respective sentence: &#x201c;purinergic P2X channels are functional in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>), but not in human sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>)&#x201d;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
